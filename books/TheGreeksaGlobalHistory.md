This book is dedicated to all my Greek friends,
acquaintances, former students, and colleagues, wherever
they are in the world today, and to the memory of those who
are no longer with us.
By so much has our city exceeded all mankind in matters of thought and
speech, that her students have become the teachers of others; she has caused
the name of Greeks to be understood, not in terms of kinship any more, but
of a way of thinking, and people to be called Greeks if they share our
educational system, rather than a common ancestry.
—Isocrates, Panegyricus (Athens, 380 BCE)
There one can see a western European acquiring his ABCs, a Russian
learning Greek, a Byzantine studying the works of the ancient Greeks, and
an unlettered Greek learning to spell the ancient language correctly.
—Anna Komnene, Alexiad (Constantinople, c. 1150)
The language given to me was Greek:
the poor man’s home on Homer’s sandy shores.
My language is my single care on Homer’s sandy shores.
—Odysseus Elytis, The Axion Esti (1959)
I do not say that we are of the same blood—because I have a horror of
racial theories—but we still live in the same country and we see the same
mountains ending in the sea.
—George Seferis, speech accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature (1963)

AUTHOR’S NOTE
In this book I use the abbreviation BCE (equivalent to BC) whenever the
year or century referred to falls before the start of the Common/Current Era.
BCE dates are counted down, so the fourteenth century BCE comes before
the thirteenth century, and so on. There was no year 0 in this system, so the
year 1 BCE was followed immediately by the year 1 CE (equivalent to
AD). I use the abbreviation CE only where the context otherwise might
cause confusion. So, whenever neither BCE nor CE is indicated, a date
should be assumed to be CE.
For more than two and a half millennia, Greek names of people and places
have been written in the Greek alphabet, described in Chapter 2. Various
conventions have been used at different times to represent these names in
the Latin, or roman, alphabet that we use in English. Because pronunciation
has changed over the centuries, the sounds represented by several letters of
the Greek alphabet are not the same today as they were in ancient times.
There is therefore no fully consistent way to write Greek names in English.
The problem is compounded because there is a long-established practice of
representing ancient Greek names in the Latin forms adopted by the ancient
Romans. These are usually far more recognisable in English today than a
more rigorous transliteration direct from Greek: ‘Thucydides’, for example,
is the Latin transcription for the name of the historian whose name was
more accurately Thoukydides. Particularly well-known names, of both
places and people, have long since acquired English equivalents: ‘Athens’,
not ‘Athenai’ (ancient) or ‘Athina’ (modern); ‘Plutarch’, not ‘Ploutarchos’.
I have tried to follow these principles in the pages that follow:
• Whenever a name has a reasonably well established English equivalent,
I use that (‘Thessalonica’, not ‘Thessalonike’; ‘Jesus’, not ‘Iesous’).

• Up to the end of Chapter 7, I use latinised spellings for most Greek
names, with exceptions for place names which are today more familiar
in their Greek form, so ‘Mycenae’ (latinised), not ‘Mykenai’; but
‘Knossos’, not the latinised Cnossus.
• For the Byzantine period, I use the closest equivalent to the Greek
letters of the name: so ‘Anna Komnene’, not ‘Anna Comnena’;
although older generations of scholars once did so, it makes no sense to
latinise the names of people who lived after the end of the Latinspeaking Roman Empire.
• For the modern period, I adapt the same principle so as to reflect today’s
pronunciation (so, someone called ‘John’ in the Byzantine period will
be ‘Ioannes’, but in the modern, ‘Ioannis’ or the more colloquial
‘Yannis’).

PREFACE

The Greek language is one of only three, among those now spoken and
written anywhere in the world, that can boast a continuous written tradition
stretching back for more than three thousand years. The others are Chinese
and Hebrew. The collective heroes and heroines of the story told in this
book are all those people who have spoken and written the Greek language
throughout the long centuries of its recorded evolution.
During that time, Greek was used at first to keep bureaucratic records,
then to preserve for posterity the heroic epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey of
Homer, that have been read with wonder by every generation since. It was
the language of the world’s first fully alphabetic system of writing. It was in
Greek that the foundations for modern philosophy and science were laid
and, later, that the apostles of Christianity would disseminate the new
religion through the New Testament. The original Greek text of the Gospels
is still read aloud in Orthodox churches around the world. Evolving as all
human speech does over time, Greek in its present-day form is the official
language of the Hellenic Republic and one of the two official languages of
the Republic of Cyprus.
The Greeks of the title and the pages that follow are to be understood as
speakers of the Greek language. The story of these Greek speakers will turn
out to be a story about identity—or rather, about identities, in the plural.
Greek speakers have been adept, ever since we first get to know them
through their earliest writings, at asking questions and interrogating
themselves. The answers they have come up with have differed greatly over
the centuries, according to cultural changes and changing historical
circumstances. Throughout history, Greeks have created types of societies
and political systems very different from one another. If they have
continuously inhabited the same southeastern corner of Europe and theeastern Mediterranean, they have also, at different times, put down roots in
many different places. Again and again, they have proved resourceful at
reinventing themselves. They have fought against different enemies, traded
with different partners around the world, worshipped different gods, even
called themselves by different names. We call them ‘Greeks’, and their land
‘Greece’, in English today because the ancient Romans first encountered a
local tribe of Greek speakers whom they called, in Latin, Graeci. In their
own language in ancient times, these people were known as ‘Hellenes’ and
their land as ‘Hellas’, as they have been known once again since the early
nineteenth century. But they have also, at different times, been Achaiwoi
(Achaeans) and Romaioi or Romioi (pronounced Romyí), meaning literally
‘Romans’.
This book asks: What can we learn from the accumulated experience of
those who have spoken and written this language, during three and a half
thousand years, about how identities are created, perpetuated, and modified
or reinvented over time? We all rely on perceptions of the past to establish
our own identity in the present. In a world ever more threatened by the
clash of mutually exclusive, monolithic identities, we might all do well to
reflect, on a more informed basis than we often do, on the ways in which
these identities come to be formed and also adapted as the world around us
changes. The story of the Greeks, based on their own words, that can be
traced all the way back to the earliest period of recorded history, sheds light
on this process rather than on any single identity, seemingly fixed and given
at any one time.
The story that follows will be rather different from anything you have
ever read about Greeks or Greece before. For one thing, it is not the story of
a place. ‘Greece’, or ‘Hellas’, was only ever a rather imprecise
geographical term in the ancient world. There was never a political entity of
that name until 1821, when Greek subjects of the Ottoman Empire raised
the flag of revolution and declared their independence. The frontiers of the
Greek state as we know it today mostly date from as recently as 1913. To
confine the story to these narrow geographical limits would be to leave out
precisely the dimension of Greek history that this book is designed to
highlight, namely, its global reach.
Also, it is not the story of a single ‘Greek civilisation’. For most of us,
unless we are booking a holiday or doing business, when we think of‘Greeks’, what comes to mind first is likely to be the artistic and scientific
achievements of a group of city-states led by Athens and Sparta around two
and a half thousand years ago. The story of that civilisation, that we still
call ‘classical’, has been told many times. And deservedly so—because it
really was the origin of much of the arts, sciences, politics, and law as we
know them throughout the developed world today. In these pages we will
often observe this process in action, and sometimes also probe the
mechanisms that enabled these achievements to penetrate so far beyond
their starting point. Suffice it for now to remind ourselves how many words
current in the globalised languages of today, particularly in scientific
terminology, come from Greek and refer to things that the Greeks were the
first either to create or to define: democracy, politics, philosophy, drama,
even crisis and epidemic, to name just a few. Many more, based on Greek
roots, have been invented in modern times to refer to inventions unknown
to the ancients: telephone, technology, photon are examples. Another is
pandemic—a real ancient Greek word given an entirely new meaning in
many languages in modern times.
But there is far more to the story of the Greeks than that. Rather than
focus on a single civilisation, however foundational for the rest of the
world, in this book I will be looking at a whole interconnected series of
civilisations. Long before the classical period came the Greek-speaking
civilisation that today we call ‘Mycenaean’. The Mycenaeans were Bronze
Age warriors. But they were also traders who amassed great quantities of
gold and built fortresses that later generations thought could only have been
the work of giants. Their world ended suddenly, about three thousand three
hundred years ago. Nobody knows for certain why. But the modern theory
of ‘systems collapse’, that has been devised to explain how this and other
world civilisations came to disappear, is one that we will encounter again,
in the rise and fall of later civilisations in which Greek speakers had an
important part to play.
The ‘classical’ civilisation began many centuries after the Mycenaean had
ended. That world of competing city-states, in its turn, came to an end when
the city-states came under the control of the powerful Greek-speaking kings
of Macedonia. The most famous of those kings, known to history as
‘Alexander the Great’, conquered the whole of the Middle East, as far as the
frontiers of India today. With that conquest began a new era that we knowas ‘Hellenistic’, when Greek first became a world language, in much the
same way as English is often said to be today.
Later still, it was the turn of Greeks to be conquered, as the power of
Rome expanded. Greek speakers living under the Roman Empire produced
their own, quite distinct version of what we call Roman civilisation. Indeed,
the whole eastern half of that empire, reaching from the Adriatic Sea in the
west to the River Euphrates in the east and as far south as Aswan in Egypt,
used Greek, not Latin, as its common language. After that came Christianity
and with it an entirely new centralised, monotheistic Greek-speaking
civilisation that for the best part of a thousand years was the envy of the
West. Nowadays we call that civilisation ‘Byzantine’, or ‘Byzantium’.
Lastly, Greeks in more recent times have played distinguished and
distinctive parts in forging the most complex society that has ever existed—
the global civilisation that we enjoy today, with all of what the founder of
psychoanalysis and devoted classicist Sigmund Freud once famously
termed its ‘discontents’.
When we look at Greek history through this perspective and tease out the
multiple ways in which Greeks have interacted with all manner of outsiders
over more than three millennia, we reach the remarkable conclusion that
Greeks have got just about everywhere. Today, the Greek language, the art
and archaeology of many different periods of the Greek past, Greek
philosophy, literature, and the ancient Greek contributions to science,
medicine, law, and politics are studied in schools and universities from
Chile to China, from Norway to New Zealand, from Siberia to South
Africa. All over the world, during the last three centuries, architects of
grand buildings, both public and private, have given a new lease of life to
the soaring marble columns and lofty pediments that the Greeks once
devised for the temples of their gods. In different ways, the heirs of those
ancient Greeks have been interacting, for centuries, with all manner of
people, all over the known or accessible world of their time.
That is why this book is called a ‘global history’.

Bronze Age

1
OF LEDGERS AND LEGENDS
1500 BCE–c. 1180 BCE

Let us imagine dawn coming up over the Aegean Sea in the year 1500
BCE. Far away to the east and south, the sun is already well above the
horizon across the Fertile Crescent that stretches from the top of the Persian
Gulf, along the course of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and westwards all
the way to the Mediterranean. Those were the lands where the
domestication of crops and animals had first begun, many thousands of
years before. Complex societies, or civilisations, have been flourishing in
those regions for longer than a millennium: in succession, Ur, Akkad,
Sumer, Babylon. In 1500 BCE, it is the turn of the Assyrians, ruling from
their capital of Ashur on the banks of the Tigris. Recently, a new centre of
power and wealth has been making its mark farther north, and closer to the
Aegean, in the highlands of Anatolia.
This is the kingdom of the Hittites. Although over the sea it is still barely
dawn, the sun rises upon Hattusa, the Hittite capital, which lies not far from
the site of the future Turkish capital of Ankara. The Hittite king maintains
an army that can field hundreds of war chariots—and another army of a
different kind, less visible, that keeps and maintains immense numbers of
records in a script known as cuneiform, devised in the Fertile Crescent
during the previous millennium. At almost exactly the same moment, far to
the south, the valley of the Nile is lit up. The sun first catches the tops of the
pyramids of Giza, which are already some fifteen hundred years old. Egypt
has been a stable kingdom, with a hierarchical society and a developed
system of writing for all that time, and has as many centuries again ahead of

it. The wealth and the fabled wisdom of the Egyptians are magnets that
draw traders and military rivals from throughout the region.
Back in Anatolia, the light is starting to pour down the river valleys that
lead westward from the plateau that is the Hittite heartland, towards the sea.
The people of the coastal lowlands have their own languages, related to
Hittite. But in 1500 BCE, they are not ruled directly from Hattusa. As the
sunlight reaches the coast, it lights up a city near the mouth of the greatest
of these rivers, the Maeander. The city is known to the Hittites as
Millawanda and will later enter Greek history under the name Miletus.
Moments later, a couple of hundred miles to the north and slightly to the
west, the strait known as the Dardanelles, or Hellespont, is beginning to
catch the growing light. On the Asian side, and a few miles inland from the
Aegean coast, the densely populated streets of an even larger city are
waking up to the new day. Built in the middle of a fertile plain, this city is
well placed strategically to profit from any traders moving from the Aegean
through the straits into the Sea of Marmara or beyond, through the
Bosphorus into the Black Sea. Its citadel is fortified with massive walls.
Below them, the much larger lower city is home to some ten thousand
people, a significant population for this part of the world at this time. What
language the people here speak, or what name they give to the place, will
not be recorded for posterity. It is called Wilusa by the Hittites and Wilios,
later Ilios or Ilion, by the Greeks—eventually to become known by the
alternative Greek name, which may be no less ancient, Troy (Troia).
The dawn light spreads across the Aegean. The first rays catch the peaks,
one after another, of the three great mountain ranges that run from east to
west across the island of Crete. Two hundred miles long, no more than forty
wide, and with no other land of any size visible from its shores, Crete is
home to an advanced civilisation that will be dubbed ‘Minoan’, after the
island’s legendary king, Minos, when its remains are discovered three and a
half millennia later. Crete under the Minoans is a land of prosperity and
plenty. As the sunlight reaches down to the coastal lowlands, on the roofs of
buildings it picks out the characteristic, stylised representations of bulls’
horns that look a little like medieval crenellations, though they have not
been put there for defence. (The first archaeologists to uncover them, at the
beginning of the twentieth century, will call them, rather portentously,
‘horns of consecration’—and the name will stick.) Larger towns are

grouped around tightly organised, complex structures that the same
archaeologists will call, conventionally, ‘palaces’. In reality, these are
centres for the collection and redistribution of agricultural produce and
craftwork. These processes are integrally linked to religious ceremonial and
ritual activity that has been developing on the island over centuries.
To most outsiders, even from the perspective of 1500 BCE, the Cretan
way of life must seem exotic. Neither the Minoan language nor their writing
system is like any other that is in use, anywhere. Minoan architecture has an
upside-down appearance: upper storeys are supported on columns that taper
downwards from the top. Ceremonial rooms in these palaces are brightly
painted, their interior walls covered with stylised frescoes in a range of
vibrant colours. Men are depicted wearing short, pointed kilts or loincloths;
women, in long, flounced skirts and short jackets that leave their breasts
bare and prominent; on occasion they hold live snakes in their hands. Both
sexes are shown with unnaturally slim waists. Other scenes depict a public
spectacle that must be part hazardous sport, part religious observance:
acrobats take it in turns to grasp a running bull by the horns and somersault
over its back, to land perfectly poised on their feet, facing the way they
have come.
Inside the palaces, tucked away and lit only by lightwells from the upper
storey, ‘lustral basins’ flanked by columns lead down into the earth and
enable celebrants to communicate with the divine powers below. One of
these is often represented in the form of a bull and is probably the
forerunner of the ‘Earthshaker’, Poseidon, worshipped in later times. It is
possible that the greatest deity of them all is the lithe-waisted, bare-breasted
goddess often represented on top of a pinnacle of rock, while wild animals
or male humans gaze up at her in adoration. Worship also takes place in
sanctuaries high on mountaintops or deep in caves. It is not unknown—and
this could even be a regular occurrence—for a young man to be ritually
killed, or for child victims to be prepared for a cannibal feast, to propitiate
those same gods.1
And the Minoans of Crete have good reason to fear them. The Aegean is a
part of the world where the earth’s crust is on the move. Often in the past,
their palaces and towns have been laid low by earthquakes. So far, each
time this happens, the Minoans have rebuilt them, more splendidly than

before. Now, as the sunlight sweeps across the sea, it illuminates the group
of islands to the north, that will come to be known as the Cyclades. Among
this group, and closest to Crete, rises into the light an awe-inspiring
monument to the destructive forces that lie deep within the earth. This is the
ring of rocky islands surrounding a sea-filled, volcanically active caldera,
that will later be known as Thera and later still as Santorini. The gently
sloping coasts on the seaward side, away from the caldera, used to boast
several thriving towns. People used to live here in two-storey houses and
painted the interiors with brightly coloured frescoes in the Minoan style.
There are probably some still living, in 1500 BCE, who remember the
catastrophic eruption that hurled volcanic debris many miles into the upper
atmosphere and buried every sign of human habitation on Thera under a
layer of more than thirty feet of ash and pumice.2
The remains of Akrotiri, as it will come to be called, will lie undiscovered
until 1967 (CE). All that can be seen in 1500 BCE are lifeless mounds of
white ash, scored with the black streaks of pyroclastic flows whose
temperature, at the time of the eruption, would have reached hundreds of
degrees centigrade. No life at all on the island could have survived the
destruction. Even after almost half a century, only the scrubbiest vegetation
has regained a foothold. Sea winds scour the surface, creating treacherous,
shifting ravines and blowing ash and grit far out to sea. It will be a long
time before any daring mariner sets foot on Thera again. The inhabitants
must have had warning, because the houses and streets that twentiethcentury archaeologists uncover will be empty of people. Further afield,
terrifying though these events must have been at the time, the eruption of
Thera has caused less long-term disruption than might have been expected.
The Minoans appear to have taken it in their stride, as they have previous
disasters. It could be, though, that more insidious effects are at work and
have yet to come to a head. Few signs of this may yet be visible, but it is
possible that public faith has been shaken, among the people of Crete, in the
deities they rely on for protection or in age-old rituals that may no longer
seem sufficient to appease them.3
At the time of the eruption the winds were blowing from the west. Least
affected would have been the people living between one and two hundred
miles upwind of the catastrophe on the mainland, whose turn it is, at last, to

greet the sunlight on this imagined morning. This is the land that after many
centuries will come to be known by the names of Hellas and later Graecia,
or Greece. Here, people live in scattered communities, year after year
balancing risks of crop failure, drought, and flash floods. Apart from a few
fertile coastal plains, land suitable for growing crops and grazing is broken
up by mountain ranges that keep communities apart from one another.
Subsistence farming and animal husbandry, mostly of sheep and goats, are
the norm. The terrain is capable of feeding only so many mouths, human
and animal. This is a constant that will never really change in all the
centuries to come.
In 1500 BCE there are no buildings anywhere on the mainland to rival
those of Crete, either in number or in scale. Until relatively recently, and
especially when compared to Crete, the whole area has been a ‘cultural
backwater’.4 But a change is in the air. This is especially evident at
Mycenae, a hilltop settlement on the edge of the plain known as the
Argolid, in the northeast Peloponnese, where a wealthy elite has begun to
emerge. The people of the southern Greek mainland are on the way up.
These are the people whose descendants, within a few generations, will
come to dominate the whole Aegean region, eclipsing the power and wealth
of Minoan Crete, and leave behind the earliest records written in Greek.
The more distant origins of the Mycenaeans, as we call these people and
their civilisation today, and the Greek language that they spoke, are lost in
prehistory. Greek belongs to the Indo-European group of languages, which
in prehistoric times spread through many populations, from the Indian
subcontinent to Iceland. It is often suggested that the first Indo-European
speakers must have arrived in the Greek mainland from the north, sometime
between 2300 and 1900 BCE (in prehistory, all dates are approximate). As
they mixed with the people who had been there before them, the language
that we know as Greek slowly emerged—distinct from others of the IndoEuropean group and incorporating elements absorbed from the older
language, or languages, of the region.5 Alternatively, it may be that a form
of early Indo-European arrived with the first farmers, when knowledge of
the techniques of agriculture first spread this far westward from the Fertile
Crescent, some six thousand years ago. In that case, the distant origin of the

Greek language may reach all the way back to the beginning of the period
that we call the Neolithic, or New Stone Age.6 Either way, Greek must have
been taking shape as a distinct language in the southernmost tip of the
Balkan Peninsula, during several hundreds of years, perhaps even
thousands, before our imagined Aegean dawn in the year 1500 BCE.
It was at the imposing citadel of Mycenae that in 1876 the German
archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann first found proof that a complex society
had flourished on the European mainland in the Late Bronze Age, a whole
millennium before the heyday of ‘classical’ Greece. Buried in what he
termed ‘shaft graves’, Schliemann uncovered the remains of the families
that had ruled there between about 1600 and 1450 BCE. The bones of the
men still showed traces of the wounds and the deformations they had
survived during battle-hardened lives. Buried with them was a fearsome
array of swords, daggers, and spearpoints. Images represented on grave
goods show scenes of fighting, lion and boar hunting, and trapping wild
bulls. In six of the burials, the face of the dead man had been covered by a
death mask of beaten gold. Women were accompanied by elaborate gold
headdresses and finely worked jewellery. In one grave, a small child had
been laid to rest encased entirely in gold leaf.7
Since then, many more finds have come to light, at Mycenae and
elsewhere in the southern and central mainland of today’s Greece. In 2015,
American archaeologists working at the site of prehistoric Pylos in
Messenia, in the southwest Peloponnese, unearthed very similar treasures of
the same period in the grave of the ‘Griffin Warrior’.8 Clearly, the elites of
the sixteenth and fifteenth centuries BCE on the Greek mainland prided
themselves on their strength and skill at arms.
The practice of burying so much wealth out of sight along with the dead
has aptly been termed ‘ostentatious waste’.9 How these riches came to be in
the hands of the Mycenaean warriors and the families buried alongside
them is something of a mystery. Their immediate source, on the other hand,
is not far to seek. It lies in Minoan Crete. The Minoans at this time had
spread their influence right across the southern Aegean. Later traditions that
King Minos of Crete had once ruled the seas probably have their origins in
the same centuries that saw the beginning of the Mycenaeans’ rise.10

Minoan outposts had been established on many of the Aegean islands, on
the west coast of Anatolia, and as far away even as Cyprus. Trade between
Crete and fabulously wealthy Egypt had been going on for centuries. This
was the route by which precious materials such as gold and ivory entered
the Aegean. It was not only the raw materials that came from Crete. Many
of the objects buried in the shaft graves of Mycenae are of recognisably
Minoan workmanship. There are so many of these that archaeologists have
concluded that craftsmen trained in Crete must have been engaged to work
for the local Mycenaean rulers. As they did so, they would have adapted
prized Minoan styles and decorations to the artistic tastes, or perhaps the
different religious beliefs and customs, of the Mycenaeans.11
But what did the warrior chieftains of obscure places like Mycenae,
Athens, Thebes, or Pylos on the mainland have to offer in return for all
these rich goods and services? Archaeologists, attuned to modern patterns
of exchange and trade, have noted that mining of copper, lead, and silver at
Laurion (modern Lavrio) in Attica seems to have begun at about this time.
Perhaps the Mycenaeans traded their surpluses for the exotic treasures that
would end up buried along with their chieftains? Or were these riches
perhaps the reward won by the very feats of arms that the graves were
designed to commemorate?
An intriguing hint comes from a fresco found in a house in the Minoan
outpost of Akrotiri on Thera. The house had been buried by the eruption
that devastated the island some time before 1500 BCE. In one of the scenes
shown in the fresco, a line of warriors emerges from the gate of a walled
town and forms up, apparently ready to defend their livestock from
attackers trying to land from ships, though they have also been interpreted
as a raiding party.12 Either way, the figures are immediately recognisable as
Mycenaeans by their beehive-shaped helmets with rows of boars’ tusks
stitched to the outside, the enormous rectangular shields that cover the
greater part of their bodies, and the spears that they carry, each twice as
long as a man. Actual remains of these helmets, traces of the shields, and
the points of the spears have all been found in mainland graves and would
often be depicted by Mycenaean artists in years to come.
This evidence tells us that Mycenaean warriors were already a
recognisable presence in the Minoan-dominated Aegean before 1500 BCE.

But the Minoans seem not to have regarded them as a threat to their own
way of life. Coastal towns such as Akrotiri had no defensive walls. At least
two of the distinctive Minoan palaces in Crete, at Malia and at Kato Zakros,
flourished on flat land right by the sea and were not fortified either. It may
well be that Mycenaean warriors acquired their wealth by offering their
services as paid enforcers for the Minoans in their Aegean possessions, on
islands such as Thera.13 In this case the communities of the mainland would
have been exporting not only copper but also surplus manpower. It would
have been a way of solving a demographic problem that the region would
often have to confront, in not dissimilar ways, in the future.
Whatever the truth, one of the few things we can be sure of is that,
beginning about a hundred years after the Thera eruption, a remarkable
reversal took place. Around 1450 BCE, most of the palaces and towns of
Minoan Crete were gutted by fire. Only Knossos, already the largest and in
some sense the most influential of the palaces, survived intact. But telltale
damage to some of the outlying buildings surrounding the palace suggests
that the cause of the disaster on this occasion was not uncontrollable forces
beneath the earth but human action. Who was responsible?
We have no way of knowing. But we do know who gained by it (which of
course is not the same thing). Those who gained the most, in the short term
and within Crete, were the rulers of Knossos. This one palace then
controlled the greater part of the island, perhaps even all of it. But in the
longer term, and over a much wider geographical area, it was the
Mycenaeans who benefited.
In Crete itself, huge changes took place, seemingly very soon after the
destructions. Most of the sinister lustral basins were filled in and no new
ones would be built thereafter. On the remote northeast coast, in the town of
Palaikastro, the destruction seems to have targeted objects of religious
significance. A rare idol, made of ivory and other precious materials, was
smashed and burned. Here and elsewhere, fragments of the ubiquitous
sacred symbol, the horns of consecration, have been found thrown away or
mixed with building material.14 Things that the Minoans had once held
sacred were now being trashed.
At the same time, parts of the Palace of Minos itself, at Knossos, were
drastically remodelled and redecorated. The wall paintings in the Throne

Room, that visitors still queue up to enter, belong to this period—though
what you see today is an imaginative reconstruction created in the early
twentieth century. Painstaking examination of the fragments of painted
plaster has revealed that the original design adapted traditional motifs for a
purpose not found in Minoan art before this time: to concentrate the
attention of the viewer on the majesty of the king, sitting on his throne.
Elsewhere at Knossos, tombs began to appear that closely resemble those of
the Greek mainland. Minoan burial customs during the previous centuries
had been for the most part communal and inconspicuous—it has been
suggested that the Minoans paid little attention to their ancestors. By
contrast, the ostentatious graves and rich displays, including many weapons
buried along with the dead in the environs of Knossos between about 1450
and 1375 BCE, closely match the customs of the Mycenaeans on the
mainland at the same time.15 Archaeologists are now reluctant to conclude
that there was anything so systematic as a Mycenaean ‘takeover’, or even
an invasion of Crete, to explain these developments. But it does look very
much as though the palace of Knossos, and therefore at this time most of
the island, had come under the control of people with close ties to the Greek
mainland.
It was not just in Crete that these changes were taking place. All over the
Aegean, within a few decades either side of 1400 BCE, it was no longer
Minoan customs and artefacts that were setting the trend but Mycenaean. In
Crete itself, centralised arrangements for the collection and distribution of
goods and the organisation of craftwork were now controlled by a single
centre at Knossos. Crete became more prosperous than it had ever been.16
And it was here, at the very heart of the Minoan system, that archaeologists
found the equivalent of the smoking gun that proves the presence of Greekspeaking Mycenaeans at the top of the new hierarchy in Crete.
Minoan society had already developed more than one system of writing
during the preceding centuries. From about 1900 BCE, the series of signs,
each representing a spoken syllable, that we know today as Linear A had
been used to keep the palace ledgers. Administrative records were incised
into tablets made of soft clay. The documents created in this way were not
intended to be permanent. But when fire ripped through the palaces, the
clay became baked hard and, as a result, preserved for archaeologists to

uncover almost four millennia later. This had happened on more than one
occasion before the general destruction around the year 1450 BCE—
enabling us to recover some of the day-to-day records of the destroyed
palaces.
But when it was the turn of Knossos to experience a damaging fire, the
clay tablets preserved in the debris were no longer being written in the
Linear A script and in the Minoan language, which has never been
deciphered. Within only a few decades after the upheavals of 1450 BCE,
the writing system at Knossos had been adapted to produce its close cousin,
known as Linear B. For half a century after the first discoveries of
documents written in Linear B, by Sir Arthur Evans and his team digging at
Knossos, no one could decipher this script either. The breakthrough came in
1952, when a young architect and amateur code breaker by the name of
Michael Ventris, working alongside the Cambridge classical scholar John
Chadwick, proved that the language of these ledgers was an early form of
Greek. Since then, a total of almost six thousand Linear B tablets, more
than half of them found at Knossos, have been deciphered and translated.
The oldest of these, again from Knossos, are now thought to date from not
long after 1400 BCE. Specialists have even detected, in their hesitant,
scratchy handwriting, the traces of a new generation of scribes learning to
adjust to the new system of writing. If this observation and this dating are
correct, then the cache of documents found in the Room of the Chariot
Tablets at Knossos represents the earliest surviving records in the Greek
language ever found.17
Whatever happened in Crete during the decades that followed the
destructions of 1450 BCE, the consequence was to install a Greek-speaking
Mycenaean elite at the head of an island-wide bureaucratic system. It was in
this way that the Greek language first made it into writing, and Greek
speakers first found themselves running a complex economic and political
system, which had already been developed by others before they arrived.
No wonder, then, if the Greek language, along with the stories and some of
the beliefs that would later come to be recorded in it, bear many traces of
this formative period. Mycenaean civilisation was a fusion born out of the
encounter between these two very different languages and cultures, of the
Greek-speaking mainland and Minoan Crete.

At the same time as Crete was being transformed, the Mycenaeans began to
build palaces of their own on the mainland. These were designed along
different lines. But evidently, they were intended to function in exactly the
same way. And it appears that they did—indeed, with as much success as
the new Greek-speaking elite had begun to achieve at Knossos. For two
centuries at least, and perhaps nearer to three, the Mycenaeans who ran
these palaces were able to create an economic system that has been called a
‘massive redistributive operation’, sufficient to support a population far
beyond anything that had been possible before or indeed would be again
until modern times.18
Scribes were employed to keep detailed inventories, in just the same way
as they were in Crete. Several fragments written in Linear B, discovered at
a house outside the citadel of Mycenae, and another at the site known as
Iklaina in southwest Greece, both excavated in the twenty-first century,
confirm that the new technology of writing and its bureaucratic purpose had
spread to the mainland by 1350 BCE.19 Many more Linear B documents,
most of them dating from the end of the following century, have also been
discovered at the mainland sites of Pylos, Mycenae, Tiryns, Thebes, Volos,
and Agios Vasileios near Sparta, as well as at other sites in Crete. The total
number found on the Greek mainland is around two thousand five hundred.
Between about 1300 BCE, at the latest, and shortly after 1200 BCE, the
Mycenaean elite was sitting at the top of a rigidly defined hierarchy of
offices run by micromanaging bureaucrats.
These documents enable us to understand many details of how the
economy and administration of the Mycenaean palaces were organised. At
the top was the king (wanax). At the opposite end of the scale, below a long
list of named officials, the local village community was called the damos—
forerunner of the later Greek demos, which would give us the word
democracy, meaning ‘power of the people’. But the Linear B records give
us no insight into the thoughts and feelings of the rulers who commissioned
them, still less of the small professional class of scribes who alone
possessed the skill to create and read them. The Mycenaeans seem never to
have used the art of writing for anything other than bookkeeping. It is
possible, of course, that they preserved other kinds of records on perishable

materials such as parchment or papyrus, as we know the Minoans did
before them. But no evidence has yet been found to prove that they did.20
Stories and storytelling, on the other hand, must have played a large part
in life in the Mycenaean palaces. We know from archaeology that the rulers
went to great lengths to keep alive the memory of ruling families from the
past. The shaft graves at Mycenae had always been marked by carved
gravestones. Some two centuries after the last burials were made there, a
ceremonial precinct was built to set apart and preserve the place where the
illustrious dead and their treasures had been laid to rest. At about the same
time, the fortification walls of the citadel were extended so as to enclose
this cemetery. These elaborate and expensive projects would have had no
meaning unless the people who commissioned them had had a highly
developed method for handing down memories from one generation to the
next.
After about 1400 BCE, monumental ‘tholos’ tombs began to appear all
over southern Greece. These were excavated out of hillsides, with
spectacular entranceways dressed with stone, and topped with stone-built
vaults that rose above ground level and punctuated the landscape. The
fancifully named Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae is the most architecturally
ambitious of these. Long ago ransacked and emptied of the burials and
goods it must once have contained, its shell has been admired by visitors
since at least the second century CE. This was another way to remember
and honour kings, heroes, and their families long after their lifetime. In
some form or other, stories about them must have been just as vigorously
perpetuated.
Signs of a taste for storytelling have often been noted in Mycenaean
visual art, too. Surviving fragments of the frescoes that once covered the
interiors of their palaces show vivid scenes of fighting or hunting. In the
Palace of Nestor at Pylos, the frescoes covering the walls, as a visitor
approaches the central hearth and the throne of the wanax, seem to mirror
the solemnity of actual processions that would have passed that way in
honour of the king. To the side, a white-robed man sits on a rock. His head
is tiny in proportion to the five-stringed lyre he holds in his left hand while
he plucks the strings with his right. Just in front of the lyre, and flying away
from him, is a bird proportionally even larger. It is hard not to think of the

stock phrase ‘winged words’ that would later be immortalised in the Iliad
and Odyssey of Homer. There was a place in the bureaucratic system of the
palaces for lyre players: a Linear B tablet from Thebes lists two as due to
receive rations. Foreshadowing later times, the lyre player was surely not
just a musician but also a ‘singer of tales’.21
The functions of the palaces combined political and economic authority
with religious ritual and belief, just as they had in Minoan Crete.
Mycenaean religion overlapped with Minoan, but there seem to have been
many differences too. These would only increase over time as the
Mycenaean elites began to emerge from the shadows of the earlier
civilisation of the Minoans. The tablets from Pylos, which date from the
very end of the Mycenaean civilisation, between 1200 and about 1180 BCE,
give us some snapshots of religious practice as it had evolved on the
mainland by that time.
Gods were both male and female. It is evident from the tablets, as well as
from remains of animal sacrifices found in the palace itself, that the most
important deity was the bull god Poseidon, in later mythology associated
with earthquakes, as he almost certainly had been previously in Minoan
Crete. His name appears in the form Po-se-da-o. A warrior goddess not
unlike the later Athena seems to have been worshipped at Mycenae, and the
name A-ta-na Po-ti-ni-i-ja (meaning ‘Lady Athena’) occurs in a Linear B
tablet from Knossos. Names or epithets found on the Linear B tablets can
be matched with most of the Greek divine ‘family’ that in later centuries
would be imagined as living on the cloud-capped peaks of Mount Olympus.
But the fussy preoccupation of palace officials with making sure that each
deity received its due, in full and on the prescribed date, tells us little about
the nature of the rituals involved, still less of the beliefs of the people who
carried them out.22
One thing the records do tell us, and which is abundantly confirmed by
archaeology, is that these palace rituals would culminate in massive
communal feasts. Just as in later times, the gods would receive their due
portion of the animals slaughtered in their honour. But it was the sharing of
meat among the mortal participants that affirmed the self-belief of the
community. If we may judge by visual representations, those feasts were
shared by women as well as men. Women feature prominently in

Mycenaean art, as well as in Minoan. Frescoes show women riding in
chariots and as spectators watching a battle. But they are rarely shown barebreasted like Minoan women. It seems that aristocratic women did enjoy
high status in the world of the Mycenaean palaces—in death, as well as in
life, on the evidence of burials that have been excavated. But when women
are mentioned in the Linear B tablets, it is almost always in menial
capacities, quite possibly as slave workers. The only woman of high status
who has so far been identified in the records was a priestess. There is no
indication that any female Mycenaean ever exercised particular authority in
a palace hierarchy. Not even a royal consort or female royal title is
mentioned in the tablets.23
Mainland palaces were built in naturally defensible positions above the
surrounding terrain. But, to begin with, they had no defensive walls. This
had been the Minoan way, and indeed in Crete would remain so even when
Mycenaeans seem to have been in charge. On the mainland, by contrast, the
palace builders and pioneers of the new centralised economy soon found the
need to protect the stored surplus produce and the high-value artefacts they
had accumulated inside. First at Tiryns, in the Argolid just outside the
modern port town of Nafplio, then at Mycenae itself, a few miles inland,
mighty walls began to rise around the citadels. These are no ordinary
fortifications. So massive are the stones of which they are built that later
generations could not believe they had been raised into position by human
beings at all but must have been the work of mythical one-eyed giants,
called Cyclopes. The circuit walls of Tiryns and Mycenae in the Argolid
and Gla in Boeotia are still called ‘cyclopean’.
These fortifications bear witness to the power of the rulers to command
the labour of many thousands of men. Labourers must have been recruited
from a wide area. To house so many and to keep them fed for the duration
of the work would have required both resources and organisation. Though
hardly on a comparable scale to the much older pyramids of Egypt, the
cyclopean walls of the Mycenaean citadels would have presented logistical
and engineering challenges very similar in kind. Where did all this
manpower come from? And why was such a stupendous expenditure of
resources and effort needed at all? Some have wondered whether the
purpose might have been simply ‘to impress and confer great status on the

rulers of the sites’.24 If this was so, it would have been an even more
remarkable case of ostentatious waste than burying such a quantity of gold
in the shaft graves.
The first fortifications went up around 1375 BCE at Tiryns and 1350 BCE
at Mycenae. A century later, at both sites, they were extended farther. This
was when the shaft graves and their ceremonial precinct at Mycenae were
brought inside the circuit of the walls. At the same time, the famous Lion
Gate was added. Above its lintel can still be seen a monumental version of a
design adapted from Minoan Crete. Two lionesses flank a central pillar that
may once have been topped with the figure of a deity, most probably a
goddess. In a final phase of fortification, considerable engineering ingenuity
must have been required, as well as heavy lifting, to enclose access to
underground springs at both Mycenae and Tiryns. The same thing was done
on the Acropolis of Athens, where few other traces have been preserved to
indicate that a Mycenaean palace must once have existed. These efforts
cannot be put down to mere ostentation. Around 1200 BCE, when the
palaces were about two hundred years old, the elites who administered their
economy were expecting to have to last out a siege.
Not all the Mycenaean palaces were fortified, at least on anything like the
scale of Tiryns, Mycenae, the Acropolis of Athens, or Gla in Boeotia.
Where they were, they tend to be clustered close together. In the small area
of the Argolid, there are no fewer than three, and all were walled in the
cyclopean style. By contrast, palaces that according to the bureaucratic
record controlled a larger territory seem to have required less elaborate
defences. This is the case at Pylos and Thebes.25 So it may be that those
elites who chose to fortify their palaces did so for protection not against any
external threat but from each other. If so, that rationale would be in accord
with much of later Greek history.
Nothing in the archaeological record or in the written documents indicates
whether administration or any form of mutual obligation extended beyond
the territory controlled by each palace. These territories could be quite
extensive, particularly when compared to the generally much smaller citystates of later times. It is rare to find references in the documents to
transactions between regional centres. From Mycenae, we have a record of
a consignment of cloth being sent to Thebes. Tablets from Thebes refer to

‘Lacedaemonians’, which ought to mean people from the region of later
(and modern) Sparta in the southern Peloponnese. But there is nothing to
give us a clue to how the separate palatial administrations interacted with
one other. Nor is there any hint of a higher level of political authority than
that of the wanax who ruled over the territory of each palace.26
The picture presented by the Linear B tablets is consistent with the
evidence of archaeology. Overwhelmingly this is a picture of autonomous
kingdoms, each managing its own affairs, but all of them doing so in much
the same way, with common standards of language, writing, architecture,
arts and crafts, and religious practice. Did all those things that they had in
common ever lead to an overarching political structure, with a single
geographical centre and a single overall ruler, as was the norm in other
civilisations at this time? In the search for answers, we have to look beyond
the Mycenaean world to see what outsiders looking in made of it.
The Hittites, with their capital far to the east in the highlands of Anatolia,
came into contact with the Mycenaeans only when the latter began to
impinge on their own side of the Aegean. Fragments of Hittite diplomatic
correspondence covering the period between 1400 and 1200 BCE—the
heyday of the Mycenaean mainland palaces—make reference to a maritime
power on the western edge of the Hittite sphere of influence. At first this
was named as Ahhiya, later as Ahhiyawa. In approximately 1250 BCE, the
reigning king at Hattusa wrote at length to an unnamed king of Ahhiyawa,
addressing him as his ‘brother’ and equal. Some forty years later, another
Hittite king, Tudhaliya IV, declared in the formal text of a treaty: ‘the Kings
who are my equals in rank are the King of Egypt, the King of Babylonia,
the King of Assyria, and the King of Ahhiyawa.’ The last phrase has been
erased by the scribe, who seems to have recognised at once that he wasn’t
supposed to include it. But the fact that a professional scribe could have
made such an error suggests that kings of Ahhiyawa had until very recently
enjoyed this level of recognition at the Hittite capital. The same treaty
places an embargo on ‘any ship of Ahhiyawa’ going to the king of Assyria,
with whom the Hittites were currently at war. This could refer either to
trade or to military reinforcements. In any case, it is evident that Ahhiyawa,
by about 1220 BCE, had become a power to be reckoned with at sea, and
indeed one of a handful of superpowers of the day.27

During the same centuries, the Egyptians, too, were in contact with the
Aegean world. The Egyptians had long been trading with Minoan Crete,
which they called ‘Keftiu’. Then, shortly after the presence of the
Mycenaeans began to make itself felt throughout the region, a new name
enters the Egyptian records. The forty-second year of the reign of the
pharaoh Thutmose III is usually reckoned to be equivalent to the year 1438
BCE, by our system of counting. In that year, the pharaoh accepted a
diplomatic gift from a place called ‘T-n-j’. Because Egyptian hieroglyphics
record only consonants, not vowels, we can only guess at the exact sound of
the name represented. But it was probably something like ‘Tanaja’ or
‘Tanaju’. From the description of the gifts, which included a piece ‘of
Cretan workmanship’, we can only suppose that ‘Tanaju’ is to be found
somewhere in the Aegean—other than Crete, since the same text already
mentions Keftiu. Almost a hundred years later, during the reign of
Amenhotep III, who died in 1353 BCE, an Egyptian monumental mason
recorded a list of regions that may have been destinations for an embassy or
trade mission to the Aegean. This time Keftiu and Tanaju appear as separate
headings. Several of the readings are uncertain, but the listed destinations
clearly imply that the territory known to the Egyptians as Tanaju covered all
of the Peloponnese, Boeotia (because Thebes is included), and perhaps
some islands.28
It seems from this evidence that the Hittites and the Egyptians had
different names for what we call the Mycenaean world. But the scribes and
officials of both civilisations take it for granted that they were dealing with
a kingdom, ruled over by a king whose status their own monarch was
prepared to recognise. The Hittite texts are quite explicit about this. Even if
we understand Tanaju as a geographical term, rather than necessarily the
name of a political state, for an Egyptian pharaoh to accept a diplomatic gift
implies that whoever ruled there was regarded as worthy to take part in this
kind of formal exchange.
If there was a single kingdom that encompassed the whole Greekspeaking, Mycenaean world of southern Greece, the most likely candidate
for its capital would be Mycenae, though Thebes has also been proposed.
Or there may never have been a unitary kingdom at all, but rather some sort
of confederacy of smaller states, whose different names might have

confused outsiders.29 Either way, the Hittite and Egyptian sources reveal a
geopolitical dimension to the Mycenaean world that must have some basis
in fact, even if we still don’t know how to square this information with the
evidence of archaeology and the Greek records.
But how did the Mycenaeans define themselves and the land where they
lived, in their own language? Both the Hittite name, Ahhiya or Ahhiyawa,
and the Egyptian, Tanaju, would find close echoes in Greek several
centuries after the Mycenaean civilisation had ended. We find these in the
epic poems of Homer, the Iliad and the Odyssey. There, the people who lay
siege to the city of Troy are known collectively not by the later name of
‘Hellenes’ but as ‘Achaeans’ (echoing Ahhiya) or ‘Danaans’ (echoing
Tanaju). The place name Achaea would continue in use for centuries,
though not always attached to the same place, right through to the end of
the Roman period. It seems most likely that, if the Mycenaeans did have a
single name for all the lands they lived in, it was something like Achaiwia,
an early form of Achaea. And those whom we call Mycenaeans most likely
thought of themselves, as Homer’s heroes would later do, as both Achaeans
(Achaiwoi) and Danaans—because where else could the Hittite and
Egyptian names have come from?
However they organised their affairs in their homeland, the Mycenaeans
increasingly made their presence felt far beyond it. On several occasions,
the Hittite vassal states on the Aegean coast of Anatolia attempted to rebel.
The first time this happened was around the year 1400 BCE. A revolt by
some twenty cities or states in northwestern Anatolia was serious enough to
require a military expedition led by King Tudhaliya himself to put it down.
Among the rebels was Wilusa (Troy). Once it was over, among the spoils
dedicated to the Hittite Storm God in his temple was a bronze sword, of
Mycenaean type, that would be discovered by archaeologists in the
twentieth century. The weapon bears an inscription in Hittite giving thanks
for victory in putting down the revolt. Support for the rebels, then, seems to
have come from Ahhiyawa—that is to say, from the Greek speakers across
the Aegean.30
Not long after this, a Hittite inscription records a ‘ruler of Ahhiya’ making
new trouble for Hattusa. The name of this ruler, Attarissiya, would be

preserved by much later Greek legends as Atreus, the father of
Agamemnon, king of Mycenae. Attarissiya is not dignified in the Hittite
document with a royal title. Nonetheless, he was apparently capable of
mustering a force of a hundred war chariots on the Anatolian mainland.
Sometime later, this same Attarissiya took part in a raid on Cyprus, another
Hittite vassal. This is the first clear indication that the Mycenaeans had at
their disposal a significant naval force. It may also have been the first time
that Greek speakers began to make their presence felt in Cyprus.31
The height of Mycenaean power abroad seems to have been reached
between about 1350 and 1250 BCE. This was achieved not by feats of arms
alone. The rulers of the Mycenaean palaces were also capable of exercising
something resembling ‘soft power’, as we understand it today. Documents
written in the Linear B script mention goods such as textiles and scented
oils as being ‘for export’. Trade will have taken the form of barter and
exchange. It is presumed that the Mycenaeans also took part in ritualised
exchanges of gifts between rulers, such as that recorded with Pharaoh
Thutmose. Frustratingly, no comparable records of international
transactions have so far been discovered on the Greek side.
Despite this absence of documents, we know from archaeology that
Mycenaean traders at the time were exchanging goods all over the
Mediterranean. Their ships travelled as far west as Sardinia and the coast of
Spain, in the opposite direction to the ports of Egypt and the Levant, and
through the straits of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus into the Black Sea.
Specialist raw materials came from places even more distant. Amber, used
to make necklaces, must have been transported partway by river or overland
from the Baltic. Tin, an essential ingredient of bronze, most probably came
from Afghanistan, via the Levant coast.
The cargo of a ship that sank in about 1300 BCE while on its way from
the Levant via Cyprus towards the Mycenaean Aegean included ten tonnes
of copper ingots together with quantities of tin, jars that would have
contained olive oil and apparently resinated wine, coloured glass, raw ivory,
and several precious objects. Personal items belonging to the crew or
passengers also turned up on the seabed. These included tools, weapons,
cosmetics, and jewellery, as well as the remains of what they ate onboard
and a wax tablet that must have been used for writing—though sadly with

no trace of anything that might once have been written on it. Some of the
personal possessions reveal from their design that their owners were
Mycenaeans heading for home when their ship foundered off the headland
in southern Turkey known as Uluburun, which gives the wreck its name
today. Objects recovered have been identified as ‘Egyptian, Nubian,
Assyrian, Babylonian, Cypriot, Mycenaean, Italian, Balkan, and Baltic’—
showing what a truly worldwide network of exchange, relative to the
possibilities of the time, already existed in 1300 BCE.32
Those early Greeks, and the ships they must have built to carry them and
their goods in all these directions, were already a major trading force. This
seafaring tradition, which has given Greeks their preeminent place in the
modern world of shipping today, began early—though it is worth noting,
this, too, was something that they must first have learned from their Minoan
predecessors.
One other export, this time almost invisible in the archaeological record
but destined eventually to become the most important of all, can also be
traced back to the Mycenaean world of the thirteenth century BCE. This
was the Greek language. Other than in Crete, no written records in the
Linear B script have been found outside the Greek mainland. But it is a
reasonable bet that wherever Mycenaean goods were exported, some
knowledge of the language spoken by the manufacturers and traders would
have reached there too. As a result, in places where the local people were
not Mycenaean at all, it was becoming fashionable to give people names
that we can recognise today as Greek.
Our best evidence for this comes from Crete. Within a few generations of
the arrival of Greek-speaking rulers at Knossos, many of the individuals
who appear in Linear B documents have Greek names. Those named go far
beyond the ranks of the elite. Often they are humble shepherds and
craftsmen, who must surely have been local people.33 Possibly, these names
were handed out by the bureaucracy—much as condescending colonial
masters in more recent times would do with native servants. Or it might be
better to think of something more like the practice traditional in Greece
closer to our own day, whereby parents invite a wealthy or influential
godfather to baptise their children, who then carry the name of a designated
benefactor as their own. In this way, ‘becoming Mycenaean’ might have

been a conscious choice made by individuals in a fluid and changing
society.
A more surprising case was Troy. Culturally, archaeologists are agreed,
Troy was an Anatolian city, on the fringe of the Hittite world. But during
the reign of the Hittite king Muwattalli II, who ruled from 1290 to 1271
BCE, a treaty was drawn up with the ruler of Wilusa (Troy), who is named
as Alaksandu.34 This can only be the Hittite rendering of the Greek name
‘Alexandros’ (Alexander), which means, literally, ‘defender against men’.
In later Greek legends, Alexander would be an alternative name for the
Trojan prince better known as Paris. There could be a connection between
this Alaksandu and a dynastic marriage that had apparently taken place
about a century before, between a king of Ahhiyawa and a princess of the
confederacy that had rebelled against Hittite rule, and had included
Wilusa.35 Or perhaps Greek names were becoming popular here, too, during
the heyday of the Mycenaean palaces? Royal outsiders as far away as Troy
might have wished to adopt what they saw as a winning fashion—as indeed
another dynasty of Alexanders would do almost a thousand years later, and
end up conquering the whole of the known world.
The Mycenaean ascendancy came to an end during a period of only a few
decades either side of the year 1200 BCE. As always in archaeology, the
exact sequence of events across many different sites is hard to piece
together. Establishing the causes of the Mycenaean collapse is even harder.
Palaces and fortifications had been severely damaged before but had then
been rebuilt. The Mycenaeans had proved themselves as capable as the
Minoans before them of withstanding natural disasters and carrying on. But
at a certain point, each of the great Mycenaean palaces was destroyed. Most
were burnt out. Whether they were actively ransacked is less clear.
These catastrophes happened without warning. At Thebes, a routine list of
barley rations, due to be handed out to a list of named individuals, had only
just been completed. The clay had not yet had time to dry when the entire
palace succumbed to fire. At Pylos, no human remains were found inside or
near the palace, as might be expected if defenders had fought to save it from
invaders or if an earthquake had trapped victims under the rubble. But
archaeologists did find the bones of at least ten cattle. Evidently, a sacrifice

had just taken place. The bones had been ritually burnt, then brought
indoors, perhaps for the archivists to record the details. The expected feast
would have been in full swing outside, in the open air. This was the moment
when flames engulfed the palace.36 Even today in southern Greece, summer
wildfires frequently destroy homes and whole villages, sometimes with the
loss of dozens of lives. It could have been an accident.
Any number of more dramatic explanations have been offered to account
for this accumulation of disasters: invasion by sea, civil war, popular
uprising, climate change, crop failure, or some combination of these. But
none addresses the key question. This is not how or why each palace came
to be destroyed, but why it was never rebuilt. And what can have caused
other settlements to be abandoned at the same time, without any sign of
destruction? Why, even at sites like Mycenae and Tiryns, where some
reoccupation and rebuilding did take place, were the ruins of the palaces left
untouched?
Since the 1970s and 1980s, systems-based theories have been developed
to account for the collapse of an entire civilisation on such a scale.37
Systems collapse will reappear several times in the course of this longer
history as an explanation for catastrophic changes that affected Greeks at
different times and in different historical circumstances. According to this
theory, it is the very complexity of the system that brings about its downfall.
Collapse is explained by an economic model that shows how an increase in
complexity brings large benefits at first, then just about sustainable ones,
until in a final phase the cost of maintaining the system outweighs the
benefits. At this point, instead of gently falling back upon an earlier phase
of the cycle, the system becomes vulnerable to increasing threats. Once
upon a time, these threats would have been easily seen off. The steps taken
would have brought a further increase in the complexity of the system. But
with complexity already past its peak, the costs of further action outweigh
the benefits and cannot be met.38
A good example of how this might have worked in practice can be seen in
the fortifications of the Mycenaean palaces. Up to a certain point, it must
have made sense to the rulers to mobilise vast resources and command huge
workforces in order to bring more of the palace’s essential functions and
personnel within the area protected by the walls. Later, when the perceived

threat became more acute, it still seemed worth the effort and expense to
enclose access to the water supply within the circuit. But what do you do
when the next threat appears, and this time the cost of meeting it is greater
than the system can bear? At this point, following the theory of systems
collapse, competing sections within society begin to doubt that their own
interest is best served by the system that supports all. The mechanism of
collapse now sets in. Unless a rival power is on hand to take over and
incorporate the failing society into its own more viable system, collapse
becomes inevitable.39 The first of these possible outcomes would well
account for what happened in Crete around 1450 BCE, when an internal
collapse of Minoan civilisation seems to have been reversed by intervention
from the rising power of the Mycenaean mainland. The second would
account very well for the demise of the entire Mycenaean political and
economic system around 1200 BCE.
It wasn’t just in Greece and the Aegean that this happened. At about the
same time, a similar fate befell Troy. All the other cities of the Anatolian
coast went the same way. So did the entire Hittite empire and most other
civilisations of the Levant. Egypt alone survived with its institutions intact,
although only after several decades of upheaval. Much has been made of
Egyptian records which refer to attacks on the coast of Egypt by ‘Sea
Peoples’. Certainly, large numbers of people must have been on the move
around the eastern Mediterranean after the multiple collapses. But at least
in the Greek-speaking world, these movements were a consequence, not a
cause. Whatever happened elsewhere, seaborne invaders cannot account
convincingly for the destructions in Greece, where most of the destroyed or
abandoned sites were not on open coasts. The same must apply to the
destruction and abandonment of the Hittite capital of Hattusa, which lies
many hundreds of kilometres inland. In all probability it was the sheer
weight of all these cyclopean fortresses, and of the top-heavy bureaucracy
that had grown up around them, that brought them down.40
The first attempt by Greek speakers to emulate the more advanced
complex societies (or civilisations) of the Near East had ended in failure.
No more palace records seem to have been kept after about 1180 BCE. The
Linear B script would soon be forgotten, except in faraway Cyprus. Despite

this, stories about the Greeks’ legendary past would continue to pass from
generation to generation by word of mouth. To an extent that can be traced
for few other prehistoric societies, the Mycenaean age gave birth to
collective memories that would later take on a new life as a result of being
written down. The stories that resulted—the myths and legends of ancient
Greece as we know them today—would never subsequently cease to be
read, copied, embellished, and commented upon.
Consider the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur. According to the story,
the king of Athens is obliged to send a regular tribute of seven lads and
seven maidens to King Minos of Crete to be devoured by a monster that is
half-man, half-bull and lives in a ‘labyrinth’ beneath his palace. With the
help of Minos’s daughter Ariadne, Theseus kills the beast and escapes with
his companions back to Athens. On the way, as well as ungratefully
abandoning Ariadne on the island of Naxos, he destroys the Cretan war
fleet, thereby putting an end to the tribute and, implicitly, to the supremacy
of King Minos at sea.41 We have abundant evidence that between about
1700 and 1450 BCE the Minoans did indeed enjoy such supremacy.
Certainly, they exercised a great deal of cultural influence in all the
mainland centres that have been excavated. There was a Minoan settlement
on the island of Keos, which is about as close to Athens and the silver
mines at Lavrio as you can get without coming ashore on the mainland. It is
perfectly possible that Athens and its surrounding region, Attica, had once
been a Minoan dependency.
If that were the case, Theseus’s expedition and its successful outcome
would be a distant reflection of the tussle for power that must have taken
place in the Aegean, between the mainland and Crete, in the years either
side of 1450 BCE. The non-Greek name ‘Minos’ may well reflect a dynasty
or a royal title rather than the name of an individual. The ‘labyrinth’ in
which the monstrous Minotaur was housed can be interpreted as a memory
of the Palace of Minos at Knossos, the remains of which do indeed very
much resemble the later metaphorical meaning of the term, as a maze. It has
been speculated that ‘Labyrinthos’, or something like it, may have been the
original name for the palace of Knossos in the Minoan language, and indeed
a version of it occurs on a Linear B tablet.42

The Minotaur itself, supposedly the issue of a union between Minos’s
queen Pasiphae and a miraculous bull sent by the god Poseidon, similarly
reflects the importance of the cult of the bull in Minoan worship and
iconography. And the story’s most shocking and memorable element of all,
that the Cretans nourished their monster on the flesh of young human
victims, has even found its counterpart in the butchered bones of children
found together with cooking pots in a building close to the palace at
Knossos. These bones date from shortly before the upheavals that led to the
Mycenaean presence in Crete after 1450 BCE. Whatever grim ritual lay
behind these remains, it would hardly be surprising if the memory of being
at the receiving end had persisted for hundreds of years afterwards.43
Other features of these stories may also preserve distorted historical
memories, unless they reflect fundamental human anxieties—or perhaps
more accurately, male anxieties. It is partly thanks to the father of
psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, that everyone has heard of Oedipus, who
killed his father and married his mother (though without knowing who they
were). Freud relied heavily on one version of this story, as told by the
Athenian dramatist Sophocles in the fifth century BCE, as evidence to
support his theory of the Oedipus complex. According to this, every male
child at a certain stage of development experiences impulses that mirror the
actions of Oedipus.44
These stories are full of powerful, feisty women. Think of Clytemnestra,
who murders her husband Agamemnon on his return from war, and their
daughter Electra, who eggs on her brother, Orestes, to kill their own mother
in revenge. Or the enchantress Medea, who in the story of Jason and the
Golden Fleece performs much the same role as Ariadne in the tale of
Theseus; instead of being dumped on the way home, Medea becomes
Jason’s wife and the mother of his children—only to murder them later in
revenge for his infidelity. The gorgon, Medusa, whose hair is made of
snakes and whose gaze turns men to stone, has become literally a monster.
Minos’s insatiable queen, Pasiphae, was fairly monstrous, too, and her
alleged sexual appetites gave birth to a monster: the Minotaur.45
It has sometimes been speculated that these stories reflect a dimly
remembered Minoan society in which women had enjoyed a much stronger
public presence, and quite possibly also more political power, than in any

Greek society that we know about. The notion that Minoan Crete had been
a form of matriarchy (that is to say, actually ruled by women) was
popularised in the twentieth century and still has its adherents today—
although it has been pointed out that no such society is known to have
existed anywhere in the world. But it is a striking fact that Greeks of the
classical age reserved prime positions for dominant females in their stories,
while largely excluding women from public roles or positions of authority
in real life. Is this the result of perennial male anxieties, of the sort proposed
by Freud, or an enduring revulsion from a different type of society that
Greek speakers had once been closely involved with and ever since were
determined to shun?46
In some respects the most powerful—and dangerous—of all these
legendary women was Helen. The most beautiful woman in the world,
Helen was capable of arousing undying enmity among immortal goddesses
and causing the great war that ever afterwards would become a focal point
of all the interconnected web of myths and legends. This was the war
between a combined force of Greeks and the city of Troy. When Helen
deserted her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta, and eloped with the
handsome Trojan prince Paris, also known as Alexander, the Greeks
mounted a mighty expedition to bring her back. In later times, even Helen’s
name would be routinely held up as a warning by Greek authors who liked
to pun on its first part, which can also mean ‘destroyer’.
The war lasted ten years, so the story goes. In the end it would be won not
by overwhelming force but by ingenuity. As famous as Troy or Helen is the
stratagem of the Wooden Horse, or Trojan Horse. This was the device that
enabled the besiegers to send a concealed advance guard inside the city to
open the gates for the rest, while the Greeks pretended to give up the siege
and sail for home. After totally destroying the city, murdering its
inhabitants, and taking the women as slaves, the victors gained little from
their triumph. Helen’s return to the husband she had abandoned back in
Sparta, and to a life of blameless domesticity, is an anticlimax. Most of the
men who had led their contingents to the war would find only troubles on
their return. Odysseus, who had devised the ruse of the Wooden Horse,
would have to endure a further ten years of wandering upon the seas before
reaching his home in Ithaca. Even then, he would have to fight to repossess

his kingdom and be reunited with his faithful wife Penelope—whose
constancy in the face of adversity would often be held up as a foil to the
behaviour of the more flamboyant heroines of Greek myth.
Does this legendary war, too, derive from real events in the lost history of
the Mycenaean age? Opinions have been divided ever since ancient times.
At least one popular retelling of the story for the twenty-first century takes
it for granted that there really was a Trojan War. Heinrich Schliemann, back
in the nineteenth, had never doubted it. Schliemann’s discovery during the
1870s, that great Bronze Age cities had flourished at Troy and at Mycenae,
seemed to prove him right. But since then, any chance of locating Homer’s
sack of Troy in the archaeological record has seemed to recede. These days,
most archaeologists are sceptical, if they do not dismiss the possibility
altogether.47
If such a war did take place, the most likely context for it might be during
the twilight of the Mycenaean world rather than during its heyday. By 1200
BCE, the Mycenaeans had been driven by the Hittites from the coast of
Anatolia. But then the Hittites, too, disappeared suddenly from the scene.
There must have been a power vacuum in western Anatolia during the first
years of the twelfth century BCE. Troy may have been the richest city in the
whole region still left standing, a prize quite literally ‘to die for’, in a time
of failed and failing states. Excavations at the site reveal that Troy was
violently destroyed, and probably also sacked, around 1180 BCE. It may be
only coincidence, but according to one set of calculations made in the
ancient world, the War of Troy was supposed to have lasted from 1194 to
1184 BCE, by our system of counting.48
During the same years, archaeology tells us that on the northern edge of
the Mycenaean world, in the coastal part of Thessaly, a late arrival among
Mycenaean palaces briefly flourished before it, too, collapsed a few
decades later. This was the region where, according to legend, the young
Achilles ruled. In later retellings of the story, much is made of the tussle
between the king of Mycenae, Agamemnon—presented as higher in
authority but a hopeless leader—and Achilles, who proves himself the
greater hero. Perhaps the rivalry between the two dramatises a distant
historical memory of a power struggle between a youthful offshoot of the
Mycenaean world in Thessaly and the traditional centre, whose authority

was failing, at a time when the Mycenaean system was crumbling and some
of its survivors had set their sights on the glittering prize of Troy?49
If we were to think of the Greek expedition not so much as an organised
show of strength by a united force in its prime but more like a desperate act
of piracy by a warrior elite whose world back home was falling apart, we
would not be all that far from the picture that emerges from the later written
versions. It is striking that many of the heroes have no expectation that they
will ever return home. Those who do have a hard time of it. And as the
story would later be told, there is a lingering sense that the effort to conquer
Troy had been the last gasp of a dying age.50

‘HOMER’S WORLD, NOT OURS’
c. 1180 BCE–c. 720 BCE

A

fter the Palace of Nestor burned to the ground, no one ever again

returned to build and live on the hilltop where it had stood. Only the name,
Pylos, remained in memory—in due course to be transferred to a different
place, some miles away on the coast. At Knossos, in Crete, the story was
much the same. Here the name remained, but the new town that would grow
up, in centuries to come, would never encroach on the ruins of the former
palace. Mycenae and Tiryns, with their massive ‘cyclopean’ walls,
continued to dominate the landscape of the Argolid. But at the highest
points within their citadels, nothing remained but fire-gutted ruins. At both
sites, humbler dwellings clustered in their shadows. All over the
Mycenaean world, it would have been impossible to escape from the traces
of the past. Ruined, deserted palaces and public buildings must have
seemed like an ever-present reproach to the current generations that no
longer possessed the means, or perhaps even the will, to build anything
more than rudimentary shelters. Stone-built houses that still stood were
used to bury the dead, while the living made do with makeshift mud huts. It
must have been like living in a ‘ghost world’.1
Within a single generation, in the towns and villages that had made up the
kingdom of Pylos, as much as 90 per cent of the population may have been
lost. Whether from famine, from disease, or from warfare, people would
have died by the thousand if this estimate is anywhere near accurate. Not all
regions fared quite so badly. But long-term trends show that the sudden,
catastrophic drop in population observed in the southwestern Peloponnese

was no temporary blip. Over the next two hundred years, at a cautious
estimate, the population throughout the Greek mainland fell to no more than
half of what it had been in Mycenaean times.2

2. The geopolitical world of the Iliad

3307

Many of those who survived abandoned their homes to find the means of
subsistence elsewhere. Some took to the mountains of the interior of the
Peloponnese to try to eke out a living from marginal land that had probably
never been cultivated before. Others headed overseas while ships were still
serviceable and crews could be found to take them. In this way, new
settlements were established on islands in the Aegean and Ionian Seas, and
farther afield in Cyprus. In Crete, but not on the mainland, coastal sites
were abandoned and people moved inland, to higher ground.3 Here and
elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, where seaborne invaders brought
disruption at this time, the threat may have been caused by displaced
Greeks fleeing from disaster at home or even turning to piracy.
For those who remained where they were, life returned to the subsistence
level of the days before the rise of the Mycenaean palaces. Once again
people lived on smallholdings and in scattered settlements, growing and
harvesting their crops and herding their sheep and goats. Everywhere, the
Greek-speaking world fragmented into a patchwork of local communities.
Not only had trade links across the Mediterranean all but vanished, but even
those Greek communities that were relatively thriving seem not to have
been on speaking—or at least on trading—terms with one another. No
wonder, then, that the archaeologists who first began to uncover the
Mycenaean civilisation in the nineteenth century chose to describe the
centuries that followed its demise as a ‘dark age’.
Today, thanks to excavations carried out during the last fifty years, we
know that the ‘darkness’ was not quite uniform. Athens seems to have been
spared the worst. The citadel of the Acropolis was probably never
completely abandoned. And the first signs of recovery there can be detected
as early as 1000 BCE. Not far from Athens, at about the same time, on the
coast of Euboea on the other side of a narrow strait, something more
surprising was happening at the site known by its modern name of
Lefkandi. There, not long after 1000 BCE, the only building of any size to
be put up anywhere in the Greek mainland in four hundred years, so far as
we know, seems to have been designed to house the grave of a local ‘hero’.
The cremated remains of the man were accompanied by the body of a
woman, decked out in sumptuous jewellery and accompanied by the knife
most probably used to kill her. The remains of four horses, dispatched at the

same time, were found in the next chamber. Even more unusually for this
period, the people of Lefkandi during the tenth century BCE were
benefiting from renewed links with the eastern Mediterranean.
Archaeologists speak of a revival of trade. But at Lefkandi, it appears that
the transactions were all in the one direction. Precious objects buried with
the ‘hero of Lefkandi’ came from places as distant as Cyprus and Babylon.
But there is no sign in the archaeological record elsewhere to indicate that
local goods made in Euboea were being exported. Perhaps the Greeks of
Lefkandi were still living as mercenaries, or as piratical raiders, two
hundred years after the Mycenaean collapse?4
Everywhere, the centuries of darkness were a time of profound and
irreversible change. People coped as best they could. There is no clear
pattern or evidence of purpose in most of the changes that we can observe.
About 1050 BCE, the new technology of smelting iron was first developed
in Cyprus. From there it quickly spread throughout the eastern
Mediterranean. The period of human development that archaeologists and
prehistorians call the Iron Age had begun. The weapons that accompanied
the hero of Lefkandi to the underworld were made not of bronze but of iron.
Elsewhere, few communities had enough to spare that they could afford to
bury anything much at all with their dead. In the Greek-speaking world, one
of the most far-reaching technological changes in human history seems at
first to have passed most people by.5
By 800 BCE, the darkness was beginning to lift. Populations were no
longer declining. Indeed, they had begun to rise. Craftsmen were once again
creating objects that were of more than essential utility. Communities began
to exchange goods with one another again. Trading links were revived.
Greek speakers once more found themselves rubbing shoulders with rival
traders who spoke other languages. In one direction were the people they
called Phoenicians, who traded from the cities of Byblos, Tyre, and Sidon
on the eastern Mediterranean seaboard that would later be known as the
Levant; in the other, the Etruscans of central Italy.
Greeks were once again on the move in large numbers. This time they
were no longer fleeing chaos and collapse at home but seeking new and
better opportunities across the sea. Later Greek accounts present a picture
of an extraordinarily mobile population, both within and beyond the

heartland of the Greek peninsula. Much about these mass movements of
people remains obscure and the object of scholarly debate. There were still
no written records. But of two things we can be reasonably certain. First,
there was no significant influx of newcomers from outside the region. The
idea of a series of invasions by ‘Dorians’ from farther north in the Balkans,
that looms large in many twentieth-century history books, has not been
confirmed by archaeology. All the ancient sources agree that those they call
Dorians were Greek speakers and had migrated from no farther north than
central Greece. In times to come, during later collapses, successive waves
of new arrivals would leave permanent traces in all later forms of the Greek
language: Latin-speaking Romans, Slavs, French- and Italian-speaking
Crusaders, Albanians, Turks. Nothing like this happened during or after the
post-Mycenaean dark age.
Secondly, during the ninth and eighth centuries BCE, the centre of gravity
of the Greek-speaking world shifted eastwards. By the middle of the eighth
century BCE, we find Greek communities firmly established right across
the islands of the Aegean, all the way down the Aegean coast of Anatolia,
from the ruined site of Troy in the north down to Lycia in the southwest
corner and far to the east in Cyprus. In anticipation of developments to
come much later, some Greek speakers were reaching out in other
directions too: northwards to form pockets on the coast of Macedonia, and
westwards to Italy.
As Greeks became more geographically dispersed, their world was
becoming more fragmented than ever. By the time the dark age came to an
end, even the Greek language had split to form several distinct regional
dialects.6 We know this, as we know so much else about the Greek world
from that time to this, thanks to the very first of those Greek inventions
whose effects are still with us all over the world today: the alphabet.
The alphabetic revolution was every bit as transformative as the digital
revolution of our own time. The invention would create its own version of
an ‘information age’ for the ancient world—at a slower pace, to be sure, but
with equally long-term effects for the ways that humans communicate with
one another across space and time. The conceptual shift that made it
possible was even simpler than the application of binary mathematics to

electrical circuits. Indeed, it is so simple, and so much taken for granted
throughout much of the world today, that we need to pause for a moment to
grasp what was so revolutionary about it.
The basic technology of writing had been known for at least two thousand
years already—nothing new about that. By the time the Greeks were
beginning to emerge from their dark age, writing systems had proliferated
all over the Middle East. In one corner of the Greek-speaking world, in
Cyprus, Greek itself was still being written in a script closely related to
Linear B. The Mycenaean writing system had long ago been forgotten, but
the ‘Cypriot syllabary’, its close cousin, would remain in use in Cyprus
right through the dark age and until long after it had ended.7 Both these
older systems for writing Greek share the same drawback. A syllabary is a
system in which each syllable of the language is represented by its own
sign. (One of the first Greek words to be recognised in Linear B was
represented by the four characters: ti-ri-po-de, meaning ‘two tripods’.) To
make this work, you need around ninety characters. To learn to write in
Linear B or the Cypriot syllabary meant acquiring a specialist skill. And the
resulting written record still left a good deal of guesswork for the reader, as
any expert on Linear B will tell you.
Instead, the Greeks looked elsewhere. The writing system that eventually
caught their attention had been developed during the previous centuries by
the Phoenicians living on the Levantine seaboard. The language of the
Phoenicians, and the script they used to write it, belonged to the Semitic
family that also includes Hebrew. The Phoenician script was in effect a
syllabary. But by leaving out the vowels, it had the great advantage of
reducing the number of signs to just over twenty. Here was the beginning of
a system that anyone could learn. The Semitic signs were given names that
served as mnemonics for the respective sounds: alf, bet, and so on. This is
why, when the Greeks adapted this system for their own use, they called it
the ‘alphabet’.
But there was one vital difference between the Phoenician system and its
adaptation by the Greeks. And here we aren’t talking any more about ‘the
Greeks’ in general. This can only have been the initiative of a single
individual, because it happened only once, at a single point in space and
time. As well as borrowing the symbols of the Phoenician script to

represent similar-sounding consonants in Greek, this individual picked out
four other symbols that represented Semitic consonants not needed in Greek
and invented one new one, so as to represent the five basic vowel sounds
that are still found in most alphabets today. Suddenly, it was possible, using
hardly any more signs than the Phoenicians did, to write down fully and
accurately the actual sounds of speech.8 From now on, the ‘winged words’
addressed to each other by heroes on the battlefield, or by gods decreeing
human destinies, even unspoken thoughts or the fleeting contents of the
imagination, could be brought down to earth, preserved and transmitted far
beyond the time and place of the original utterance. And within a few years,
all over the sea routes that were once again being plied by Greek traders,
this is what happened.
It wasn’t just Greeks who adopted the new system. The alphabet was soon
being adapted to write Phrygian, an Indo-European language of western
Anatolia distantly related to Greek, and Etruscan, the largely undeciphered
language of the Romans’ northern neighbours in Italy. The invention was
still new when Rome itself was founded, according to tradition in 753 BCE.
Soon the Romans, too, would adopt a version of it to write their own
language, Latin. The actual form of the letters used in each region and to
write each of these languages varied enormously, particularly during the
early centuries. The distinct Greek and Roman alphabets, as we know them
today, would not become standardised until much later. But none of these
was a separate invention. We can be sure of this, because the basic system
and the equivalence between the Phoenician and the alphabetic signs
remained everywhere the same.9 This single invention—the addition to the
existing Phoenician system of separate symbols to represent vowel sounds
—lies at the root of the ‘roman’ alphabet in use all over the world today, as
well as the Greek.
Exactly when and where the invention took place are the subject of much
speculation. We will probably never know. If recent redating of some of the
earliest inscriptions is correct, it must have happened between 850 and 825
BCE. This is a little earlier than the generally accepted date of the early
eighth century. As for where, it must have been a place where Greek and
Phoenician traders rubbed shoulders. One possibility is Crete. A Phoenician
trading post had been established on the south coast of the island during the

ninth century BCE, and a sample of Phoenician writing has been found in a
tomb at Knossos, dating from the same period. Or it could have happened at
Lefkandi, or another port town in southern Euboea, since the area was a
centre for Greek trading networks at the time. Ancient traditions name
Thebes, nearby on the mainland, and also link the first ‘Phoenician letters’
with the city’s legendary founder, Cadmus. Other candidates that have been
proposed lie at opposite ends of the Greek world at the time: either Cyprus
or one of the Greek outposts in southern Italy.10
Wherever it started, to borrow a metaphor from the digital age, it very
quickly went viral. At places hundreds of miles apart, owners of decorated
drinking cups began to scratch messages onto their glazed surfaces. Often it
was no more than the owner’s name that was written, or a brief phrase of
the type ‘I belong to Philion’. Even this is revealing. There’s no point in
writing your name on a treasured possession if nobody but you can read it.
Not long after the year 750 BCE, at the trading settlement of Pithecoussae
on the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples, the owner of a high-value
painted cup went further and etched into its surface three lines of verse:
Nestor’s hearty-drinking cup am I.
He who drinks this cup will soon take fire
with fair-crowned Aphrodite’s hot desire.11
The anonymous writer playfully links together the joys of drink and sex
(Aphrodite being the goddess of carnal love). And the use of verse links the
very new technology of alphabetic writing with the rhythm and the
mythological subject matter of what must have been a centuries-old
tradition of storytelling in Greek before this time.
Within a few decades, makers of fine pots would begin to add captions to
the images that they painted on them. This was done deliberately, before the
clay was sent to the kiln for firing, and therefore as part of the manufacture.
Once again, to make it worth anyone’s while, there must have been an
assumption that if you could afford to own such an object, you and your
friends would be able to make the connection between word and image.
Literacy would still not become widespread for several centuries. But
writing was no longer the preserve of a specialised craft guild of scribes.
Aptly it has been said that ‘The early alphabet likes to declare ownership or

belonging, and it speaks in the first person’. There had been nothing like
this in the Mycenaean world, or anywhere else in the ancient Near East.12
Over the next few centuries, the alphabet would bring into existence the
forms of communication that we know today as history, philosophy, and
literature. All of these depend on the preservation and transmission of the
spoken word by means of writing. The alphabet was now unleashing the
full potential of the written word to generate and to replicate messages
beyond the control of any single authority, be it political, religious, or
commercial. This potential first manifested itself, on a scale that we still
call epic for this very reason, in two monumental poems whose written
versions are almost as old as the alphabet itself, and in all probability began
to take the shape in which we read them today not long after the year 800
BCE.13
The Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer bring to life the legendary world of the
Trojan War and its aftermath. The Iliad tells, in almost sixteen thousand
lines, of the quarrel between Agamemnon and the best of his fighters, the
youthful Achilles, during a period of only a few days in the final year of the
ten-year siege of Troy. The Odyssey, in over twelve thousand lines, takes as
its subject the adventures and homecoming of just one of the heroes,
Odysseus (also known as Ulysses), after a further ten years of wandering on
the sea. Neither epic gives anything like the whole story. From passing
allusions scattered throughout the texts, we realise that the audiences who
would have heard these poems sung or recited were expected to be already
familiar with the bigger picture.14
These stories have become so well known that it can be hard to grasp the
sheer strangeness of the original Greek texts. One thing about them is their
enormous length. Whether they were created on the page or in the course of
an oral performance, the logistical challenge would have been
extraordinary. Based on techniques that have been observed at work in
modern oral traditions around the world, it has been estimated that the Iliad
would have taken three full days to perform before an audience—much
longer if the poet was dictating his words to a scribe.15 On the other hand, if
someone had sat down to conceive an entire epic poem in writing, in a

world in which storytelling had for centuries been defined by the limits of
an evening’s entertainment and the patience of an assembled group of
listeners, how could the result have ever reached an audience? No matter
how you look at it, there’s no getting away from a singularity almost as
striking as the invention of the alphabet itself: How did the art of oral
composition in performance ever make the quantum leap into writing? In
some way, the new technology must have been the spur to a narrative
experiment on a scale that would previously have been inconceivable. But
how it was done, and why, we simply do not know.16
Then there is the language. Homer’s Greek presents a notorious challenge
to modern students. But this was the case in the ancient world as well. The
language of the epics belongs to no single place or time. It can never have
been the natural speech of any individual. Instead, the poems mix elements
taken from dialects that in the eighth century BCE were spoken in different
parts of the Greek-speaking world. At the same time, they preserve many
linguistic ‘fossils’—traces of earlier forms of Greek that, it has been argued,
go back at least as far as Mycenaean times.17
Closely bound up with the language of the poems is their metre, or verse
form. Verse is a way of organising language not just into sentences that
make sense but also according to repeated patterns of sound, that resonate
with the natural rhythms of the human body and so help to lodge them in
the brain. (Those of us who were taught to memorise and recite poetry at
school will recognise the process at once.) The metre known as dactylic
hexameter was used for all the earliest Greek narrative poetry. It also
appears in some of the oldest inscriptions that have survived from the
eighth century BCE, among them the one incised on Nestor’s Cup. It is now
generally accepted that this system must have been the creation of
generations of poets working in a tradition that functioned quite
independently of the written word, long before the invention of the
alphabet. Some would go further and see the hexameter verse form as
another inheritance from the Mycenaeans, if not even from the Minoans
before them.18
Neither the Iliad nor the Odyssey gives any indication of who its author
may have been, when or where that person might have lived, or the
circumstances in which these monumental narratives came to be born. The

name ‘Homer’ begins to appear only around 500 BCE, more than two
hundred years after the poems most probably began to circulate in written
form. Various accounts, thereafter, imagine the epic poet as having been
active somewhere on the coast of Anatolia—perhaps Smyrna or the nearby
island of Chios. ‘Homer’ is not even a name but an ordinary noun which
means ‘hostage’. From the few and contradictory scraps that pass for
information recorded in antiquity, it is evident that the Greeks of the
classical period knew no better than we do whether there ever was such a
person. The Iliad and the Odyssey may or may not have been the work of
the same poet or poets. Opinions were divided in ancient times and remain
so today. Though we still speak of ‘Homer’ (usually without quotation
marks) as a form of shorthand, there is a growing acceptance that many
different individuals, and indeed generations, must have had a hand in the
creation of the epics that we read today. Behind the name ‘Homer’ we
might do better to think not so much of an ‘author biography’ on the cover
of a book but of the credits rolling at the end of a film.
Together with the earliest books of the Hebrew scriptures, these two
poems are the oldest narratives in the world that have been continuously
copied, read, commented upon, and used as a source of inspiration by
creative artists in every genre and every generation from that time to this.
After them a cycle of six other shorter epics came into existence,
traditionally attributed to poets of whom we know even less than we do
about Homer. These poems are known to us only through summaries and a
few quotations by later authors. They seem to have been written to fill in
the many gaps left by the two great epics. Possibly these ‘cyclic epics’, as
they are known, represented more closely the living tradition that had
preserved and enhanced these stories over the centuries. Or perhaps there
was already a whiff of the library about them—conscientious attempts to
capture whatever nuggets of the oral tradition their authors could come
upon, and maybe even make up the rest. In any case, the cyclic epics never
enjoyed the prestige of their towering counterparts attributed to Homer. Of
the two, the Iliad always had pride of place, followed at some distance by
the Odyssey.19
In the earliest years, performers called ‘rhapsodes’ (literally: ‘stitchers of
songs’) had a special role in reciting the poems in public. But, as there were

many rhapsodes, active in many different places, it seems that rival versions
proliferated. None of these can have been exactly similar to the versions
that we possess today. By the 540s BCE, the poems had already become so
central to public life in Athens that the city’s ruler, Pisistratus, decreed that
definitive, authorised versions should be made. This may have been the
time when the epics acquired the prestige throughout the Greek-speaking
world that they would never lose thereafter.
Three centuries later, scholars in Alexandria in the service of the Greek
dynasty, the Ptolemies, took it upon themselves to collate all the manuscript
versions of the poems they could lay their hands on. They stripped out all
the bogus, redundant lines that had crept in through successive retelling and
copying. The result was the model texts that would ever afterwards be
copied with great accuracy right down to the invention of printing in the
fifteenth century. So anxious were the Alexandrian scholars to ensure that
the epics could be read and reliably understood by future generations that
they even introduced an innovation into the Greek alphabet. These are the
accent marks written above all words of more than one syllable that have
remained an essential part of written Greek ever since—allegedly devised
for no other purpose than to assist the understanding of a form of the
language that was already as distant from speakers in the third century BCE
as Chaucer’s English is from us. Just so important had these epics become
some six hundred years after they were first written down.
Over a period of almost a millennium after that, while Greek remained the
language of education in Egypt, from the third century BCE to the seventh
CE, more copies were made of the epics of Homer than of all other Greek
authors put together. We know this from the many thousands of fragments
cut or torn from scrolls of papyrus that were preserved by the dry conditions
of the Egyptian desert and that have come to light in the last hundred and
fifty years.20 Many of these were school textbooks. In the ancient world, to
be able to read and write, to be considered educated at all, you had to know
your Homer. But the Iliad and the Odyssey were also read and studied as the
nearest thing to a sacred scripture that the Greeks ever had. Historians,
philosophers, anyone seeking moral guidance in the everyday world or
seeking revelation about the true nature of the gods would turn as a matter
of course to ‘divine Homer’. Not even the coming of Christianity and the

toppling of the statues of the old pagan gods would greatly change that. For
another thousand years, devout Greek-speaking Christians would labour to
expound the ways in which the ancient epics had prefigured the revealed
truths of Christianity and devise ingenious interpretations that turned them
into moral allegories.21
The Iliad and the Odyssey in later times would become a fixed point of
reference for writers far beyond the Greek world. The Roman poet Virgil
famously drew on both as the models for his Aeneid. Written at the turn of
the first century CE, Virgil’s epic links the Trojan story to the origin of the
city of Rome and its still-expanding empire. In medieval and modern times,
many nations have produced their own ‘national epics’. In English, John
Milton, writing in the aftermath of the English Civil War of the 1640s, drew
on both Homer and Virgil to create the epic poem of Protestant Christianity,
Paradise Lost, first published in 1667. The twentieth century saw such
literary experiments as James Joyce’s Modernist novel Ulysses in 1922 and
the modern verse epic of the Caribbean, Omeros, by Derek Walcott in 1990.
In our own century, these quintessentially male stories have been
memorably upended by leading women novelists: Margaret Atwood in The
Penelopiad in 2006, and Pat Barker in The Silence of the Girls in 2018. And
this is to confine examples to the English-speaking world and to the written
word. Adaptations for cinema and TV go back to the early years of both
these media and the creation of the ‘swords-and-sandals’ genre.22
It is not hard to see why the epics should have had such lasting appeal.
Consider the moment in the Iliad when Hector breaks through the Greeks’
defences to set fire to the ships beached on the shore:
Then glorious Hector burst in
with dark face like sudden night, but he shone with the ghastly
glitter of bronze that girded his skin, and carried two spears
in his hands. No one could have stood up against him, and stopped
him,
except the gods, when he burst in the gates; and his eyes flashed fire.23
Or think of the ways that the homecoming of Odysseus has been adapted
in later times to stand for a universal human experience. In many languages,

today, we speak of an odyssey to describe either a long journey or a difficult
quest. Near the beginning of the twentieth century, the Alexandrian Greek
poet C. P. Cavafy wrote the poem ‘Ithaca’, which imagines Odysseus’s
journey as equivalent to life itself. Cavafy concludes:
To Ithaca you owe the splendid journey.
Had it not been for her you’d never have set out.
But she has nothing left to give you now.
And if you find her poor, Ithaca did not cheat you.
So wise as you’ve become, from your adventures,
you’ll know at once the meaning of an Ithaca.24
This may be a far cry from the actual opinions of any Greek alive in the
eighth century BCE. But Cavafy’s much-loved poem testifies to the
enduring power of the story. And there could have been no twentiethcentury ‘Ithaca’ if there had not first been Homer’s. What we now call
‘world literature’ effectively begins with the Iliad and the Odyssey.
The action of the two poems is set in an age of heroes that was imagined as
already long past before the stories came to be told. At four different points
in the Iliad, a hero is said to pick up and hurl ‘a stone, a huge thing which
no two men could carry / such as men are now’.25 The repeated expression
betrays itself as one of the traditional building blocks of oral poetry, a
ready-made ‘formula’ which the poet could adapt to fit different situations
as his narrative developed. And this ‘now’, that is contrasted to the age of
heroes, is not even fixed to any one point in time; it was already enshrined
in the oral tradition before the Iliad ever came to be written down.
Specific details of the heroic age, particularly as it is described in the
Iliad, often seem uncannily to correlate with objects or practices discovered
by modern archaeology—but not consistently with those belonging to any
one time. Some of these go far back into the Mycenaean Bronze Age. At
one point we hear of a helmet made out of the tusks of wild boars stitched
onto leather. Elsewhere a hero carries a rectangular shield large enough to
cover his whole body. We know from the Thera frescoes, buried before

1500 BCE, and other finds of that period, that these types of armour had
once been characteristic of the Mycenaeans. They were already becoming
obsolete by the time the first palaces rose on the Greek mainland.26 In
another scene, the Trojans go out to battle sporting helmets crowned with a
horse-hair plume and a horn. Helmets exactly matching this description
appear on the long-nosed, rather bedraggled-looking warriors who march
round the surface of the famous ‘Warrior Vase’ from Mycenae. But this
vase dates from about 1150 BCE, at least four hundred years after the
eruption that buried the Thera frescoes. Then there are the obsequies
devised by Achilles for his dead friend Patroclus. The poet describes how
female captives were killed above the hero’s tomb, along with his favourite
horses. Something very similar seems to have happened at Lefkandi but in a
different historical period again, in the early Iron Age, not long after 1000
BCE.27
Armour and weapons, in the epics, are made of bronze, as they had been
in Mycenaean times and for about two centuries afterwards, and not of iron,
as they more often were in the eighth century BCE. Chariots appear
regularly in the battle scenes in the Iliad. This was another feature of the
Bronze Age that had disappeared from warfare long before the invention of
the alphabet. But the poet seems unsure about how they might really have
been used in the field—and the men in the audience, who can never have
seen them in action either, appear not to have minded. Heroes in the epics,
when they die, are invariably cremated on funeral pyres. The Mycenaeans
had laid the bodies of warriors to rest in graves of varying types but almost
always intact. The change to cremation had begun towards the end of the
Mycenaean period and continued gradually until it became general during
the dark age. Later, both methods for disposing of the dead would again
coexist. But Homer knows only the practice of the dark age. Homer’s age of
heroes, then, cannot be a realistic depiction of any world that actually
existed. Rather, it incorporates elements drawn from many different times,
that range across a span of astonishing depth: from the sixteenth to the
eighth centuries BCE.28
The same applies to what might be termed the geopolitics of the epic
world. Halfway through the second book of the Iliad, the poet interrupts
himself to call upon the ‘Muses… who know all things’ to tell ‘Who…

were the chief men and the lords of the Danaäns’ (that is, the Greeks). The
section that begins here has long been recognised as in effect a separate
poem, embedded at this point. Most modern readers probably skip over the
‘Catalogue of Ships’, as it has come to be known, and with good reason.
The story is held up while the poet lists the participants in the war on both
sides. Alongside the names of places and their rulers, we also learn, for the
Greek side, the size of each contingent, measured by the number of ships
each leader has contributed to the expedition. The poet reveals a remarkable
grasp of the physical geography of the Greek peninsula and the Aegean and
describes it in terms that we would nowadays call political.29
No one in Homer’s time, or for many centuries afterwards, could have
seen anything remotely resembling a modern map. We have the advantage
of being able to see the information contained in the Catalogue laid out in
spatial form. But the ‘singer of tales’ had to spell it out in words. The act of
telling brings in the dimension of time in the form of a sequence. This
narrated ‘map’ begins in the centre, with Thebes and Boeotia, then spirals
outwards to draw a circle that encompasses the Peloponnese and the
southern part of the mainland to the north. (It may not be entirely accidental
that this was almost exactly the area covered by the modern Greek state
when its frontiers were first established in 1832.) The poet then reaches
outside the circle to bring in a number of outliers: first moving in an arc
from Crete northwards and eastwards to include several islands of the
Dodecanese, including the largest, Rhodes. Then he jumps to the far north,
where he starts with Achilles’s homeland in Thessaly and rounds off with a
rather vague account of even remoter places that mark the northernmost
edge of his world.
This presentation gives a very clear sense of a geographical, and perhaps
also political, centre and a periphery beyond it. Politically, the greatest
concentrations of power, as represented by numbers of ships, are the
Argolid, with a combined total of 180 from Mycenae and Tiryns, and Pylos
with 90. Mycenae fields the largest single contingent, 100. Agamemnon,
king of Mycenae, commands the entire expedition. Athens and Sparta, the
cities that would emerge in classical times as the rival ‘great powers’ of the
Hellenic world, are of middle rank, with 50 and 60 ships, respectively.

The opposing Trojan forces are presented rather more summarily, and of
course they have no ships to be counted because they are defending Troy
from the land. Effectively, and drawing on information given elsewhere in
the poem, we learn that the defenders of the city have been recruited from
the entire northern and eastern coastline of the Aegean, stretching from the
Axios (Vardar) River, just to the west of modern Thessalonica, all the way
round to Lycia, in the southwestern corner of today’s Turkey. Some of the
islands closest to the eastern mainland, including Tenedos and the much
larger Lesbos, also lie within the Trojan sphere. The result is a world
symmetrically split along an axis that runs through the Aegean Sea from
northwest to southeast. On land, the two alliances are neatly separated by
the highest mountain massif in the region, Mount Olympus, which is also
the home of the gods who are the final arbiters of fortune in the war being
waged between them.30
It has often been noticed that the picture presented in the Catalogue
matches the archaeological record for the Greek-speaking world in the
Mycenaean age far better than it does for Homer’s time. But it is not an
exact match for either. Many of the names listed refer to places that the
Greeks themselves, in classical and Roman times, were unable to identify.
Several of these names have now turned up in Linear B tablets and can be
linked with Bronze Age sites known to archaeologists. By the eighth
century BCE, on the other hand, the centre of gravity of the Greek-speaking
world had shifted to the eastern side of the Aegean. Homer himself,
according to tradition, and most probably his first audiences, too, on the
evidence of the language used in the poems, actually belonged to that newly
expanded eastern Greek world. Why are these things never mentioned?31
One answer must surely be that the political geography of the Iliad is
inseparable from the great conflict that forms the background to the whole
poem. The alliances and oppositions presented, according to the logic of the
story, have been created by the unique event of the Trojan War. How the
thirty-odd separate kingdoms that make up the Greek side relate to one
another in peacetime we are never told. The Trojan alliance is an even more
ad hoc affair. In other words, what divides the two sides and draws a line
across the Aegean Sea in the Iliad is nothing but the Trojan War itself. This
is not to say that Homer’s world was simply invented. Rather, it must have

been pieced together, probably over generations, if not over centuries, by
people who had been brought up on stories handed down from different
periods in the past. But the coherent whole that the Iliad, in particular,
creates is an imagined age of heroes, not the faithful record of a historical
reality.
In that imagined world, the people that we know as Greeks are never
called by the name that would later become standard: ‘Hellenes’. In the
Catalogue of Ships, ‘Hellas’ is the name given to a local region in the
kingdom of Achilles, in what would later become Thessaly. ‘Hellenes’
make up only a small group within one of the smaller contingents besieging
Troy—though of course their leader proves himself the most glorious of all,
which may help to explain how the name would eventually come to be
applied to everyone who spoke Greek. Instead, the combined forces that
make war on Troy in the Iliad, and the survivors of the expedition in the
Odyssey, are most frequently called ‘Achaeans’ (Achaiwoi). Sometimes
they may alternatively be called ‘Danaans’ or ‘Argives’ (men of Argos).
But so far as we can tell, all three of these names have the same
undifferentiated meaning, equivalent to later ‘Hellenes’. ‘Achaeans’, and
probably also ‘Danaans’, had been current in Mycenaean times, as
mentioned in the previous chapter.32
We have no means of telling how Greeks were in the habit of referring to
themselves in the eighth century BCE. If anything like a ‘panhellenic’
identity is to be discovered in the Homeric poems, whether a distant echo
from Mycenaean times or the beginning of something new in the eighth
century BCE, it is curiously elusive.33 It has been tellingly pointed out that
there is nothing resembling what we would nowadays call a national
consciousness on the Greek side in the Iliad. It is different for the Trojans:
Hector speaks movingly of the honour and necessity of defending one’s
‘fatherland’. Among the Greeks, individual heroes are identified not as
Achaean but by their place of origin—Mycenae or Argos, Ithaca or Phthia
(Achilles’s homeland). Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives only ever appear in
a generalised plural.
Nothing in the epics marks out Trojan people as being different from
Achaean people, except perhaps the detail that Priam seems to have many
wives. Some of the Trojans’ allies speak different languages, and the poet

implies that this puts them at a slight disadvantage. We aren’t told what
language the Trojans speak among themselves (nor the Achaeans, either, for
that matter). But both sides communicate with each other all the time, and
without any hint of a language barrier, so we must presume in Greek.
Neither the poet nor any of the characters, who often hurl defiance at each
other in long speeches, expresses any sense of superiority for one side or
contempt for the other on the grounds of being Achaean or Trojan.34
Both sides worship the same gods, whose home is on the cloud-covered
peaks of Mount Olympus. Many scenes in the two epics are set there.
Already in the first book of the Iliad, we meet Zeus, ‘Cloud-Gatherer’ and
‘Thunderer’, lording it over a dysfunctional family of nine other named
gods and goddesses, who constantly conspire with each other or with
favoured mortal heroes on one side or the other. The kingdom of Zeus
among the clouds is as full of quarrels as the councils of men down below
—with the difference, often wistfully invoked by poet and characters alike,
that the Olympians live forever.35
Achaeans and Trojans approach these gods in identical ways. A hero begs
a particular deity for a favour and promises rich sacrifices in return. Gods
and goddesses are pleased or displeased by the amount of respect paid to
them by mortals. Often, they intervene in person on the battlefield—either
invisible to humans or in human disguise, penetrable only by the poet or
sometimes by a hero at a heightened moment that brings a sense of frisson.
Zeus has decided in advance that Troy is to fall and that Odysseus will be
allowed to return home. But there is plenty of room for the scales of
advantage to tip one way or the other through the ten years that elapse
before either of these destinies can be fulfilled. There is never any
suggestion that the ‘Greek’ gods show special or consistent favour to the
Achaeans because they are Greek. There is nothing in Homer to compare
with the ‘chosen people’ of the Hebrew scriptures.
On both sides, too, the heroes share the same code of values. It is
honourable to die in battle and still more honourable to be remembered for
your deeds long afterwards. Achilles knows that he has been given a choice:
Either,
if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,

my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;
but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,
the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life
left for me…
To run away to save your skin is dishonourable. And the greatest dishonour
is for that, too, to be remembered after you are gone. Hector resolves to
stand up to Achilles in the duel in which he will lose his life because he
fears that if he does not:
someone who is less of a man than I will say of me:
‘Hektor believed in his own strength and ruined his people.’
Thus they will speak; and as for me, it would be much better
at that time, to go against Achilleus, and slay him, and come back,
or else be killed by him in glory in front of the city.
And shortly afterwards, when he realises that the gods have deserted him
and he must die, Hector concludes:
Let me at least not die without a struggle, inglorious,
but do some big thing first, that men to come shall know of it.
For Achaeans and Trojans alike, in the bleak world of the Homeric
poems, the generations of men are like generations of leaves that flourish,
fall, and are forgotten.36 The only compensation worthy of a hero is to win
‘the fame of men’ and to have his deeds commemorated long afterwards in
song. What makes him a hero is neither his homeland nor the cause he is
fighting for but the monumental song that preserves his memory.
And so in the end, the true heroes of this story turn out to be not the
warriors, with their deeds of valour or ingenuity, but the poet and the Greek
language in which he tells his tale. The Iliad and the Odyssey do not single
out the deeds of Greeks and glorify them over the deeds of others. Anyone
can win a place on the roll of honour if he lives up to a set of values that the
poet assumes are universal. In many ways, the most sympathetically
presented of all the heroes in the Iliad, on either side, is the ‘enemy’
champion, Hector.37 Homer’s world is a Greek world only because Homer’s
words are Greek. And that world is, above all, a world of the imagination.

For all its multiple points of reference to a history that may reach back
through hundreds of years, the real significance of that world lies in what it
tells us about the Greek imagination, in or around the eighth century BCE.
In both epics, the main story of heroic words and deeds is punctuated by
little vignettes drawn from everyday activities such as farming, hunting, or
seafaring. These would have been part of the familiar experience of the
poems’ audiences. Known as ‘epic similes’, many of these vignettes seem
to open up windows that enable us to look into the lives and experience of
ordinary Greeks living in the eighth century BCE. Often extending to
several lines of verse, there are almost two hundred of them in the Iliad.
The Odyssey has far fewer. But one stands out because it brings home to the
listener the horrors that await the inhabitants of a sacked town—seeming to
imply that it could easily be your turn, and your family’s, anytime:
… as a woman
weeps, as she falls to wrap her arms around
her husband, fallen fighting for his home
and children. She is watching as he gasps
and dies. She shrieks, a clear high wail, collapsing
upon his corpse. The men are right behind.
They hit her shoulders with their spears and lead her
to slavery; hard labor, and a life
of pain. Her face is marked with her despair.38
Even in time of peace, in both poems a typical activity is to go rustling
somebody else’s livestock. In the Iliad the worldly-wise old windbag Nestor
tells the story of how he first won his spurs in a glorified cattle-raid that
blew up into a mini-war when things got out of hand. Odysseus, while still
a boy, had been sent by his father from Ithaca to the mainland to reclaim
three hundred stolen sheep. And at the end of the Odyssey, when he has
killed the suitors who had been besieging his wife and depleting his stores,
the hero knows only one way to begin to recoup his losses:
I have to go on raids, to steal replacements
for all the sheep those swaggering suitors killed,

and get the other Greeks to give me more,
until I fill my folds.39
Activities such as these seem to be taken for granted by poet and audience
alike, because they elicit no comment. Another is trading by sea, something
that we know Greeks were once again doing on a large scale by the eighth
century BCE. Usually, in the Odyssey, sea traders are depicted as
Phoenicians. They are usually also devious tricksters—though hardly worse
in this respect than the hero himself, Odysseus ‘of many wiles’. As in many
other societies of later times, trade is presented as no occupation for a
gentleman, still less for an epic hero. But Odysseus, that master of disguise,
is several times permitted to pretend to be a trader—and even the goddess
Athena is not above doing the same on occasion. Often the line between
legitimate exchange of goods and piracy or plunder appears to be easily
crossed. The Cyclops, the savage giant with one eye, shortly before he starts
to eat his uninvited guests for dinner, suspiciously demands of Odysseus,
newly arrived at his cave:
Where did you come from
across the watery depths? Are you on business,
or roaming round without a goal, like pirates,
who risk their lives to bring disaster
to other people?40
Although heroes on the battlefield are expected to have higher motives,
the force that drives ordinary people in the real world of the eighth century
BCE is the brute reality of hunger and the fear of starvation. In another of
his disguises, this time as a decrepit old beggar, Odysseus gives voice to a
motivation that listeners to the poem would surely have had no difficulty in
recognising:
There is no way to hide a hungry belly.
It is insistent, and the curse of hunger
is why we sail across the relentless seas,
and plunder other people.41

On the positive side, a special place in the world of the epic poets is
reserved for song. In the Iliad, the great Achilles is not too proud to console
himself by playing on the lyre and ‘singing of men’s fame’, while sulking in
his tent with only his companion Patroclus for company. But it is in the
Odyssey that we encounter the ‘singer of tales’ at work. The suitors, who
have taken over the hero’s palace in his absence to pay court to Penelope,
have conscripted the services of the local bard to entertain them while they
plunder Odysseus’s storerooms and feast to their hearts’ content. And at the
court of the imaginary kingdom of the Phaeacians, the blind singer
Demodocus is loved and honoured by all—indeed, his name might loosely
be translated as ‘pillar of society’. Demodocus moves the hero to tears
when he takes up his lyre and sings the story of the Wooden Horse and the
sack of Troy, as vividly as though he could have actually seen these things.
This episode in the Odyssey is probably the origin for the legend, often
repeated in antiquity and since, that Homer himself was blind. Clearly no
aristocratic feast would be complete without its ‘singer of tales’.42
These vignettes in the Iliad and the Odyssey are not our only witnesses to
what life was like for Greeks in the eighth century BCE. At about the same
time as the great epic poems first made it into writing, or perhaps a little
later, Hesiod of Ascra also took up his pen. Much shorter than the epics, and
more personal too, Hesiod’s two surviving poems are known today as the
Theogony (or Birth of the Gods) and the Works and Days.
The first of these tells a story of origins. But in the course of telling this
cosmic tale, a poet for the first time in Greek literature gives us his name
and tells us how he had learned the art of song—directly, he would have us
believe, from the Muses, the patron deities of the arts, on the slopes of
nearby Mount Helicon.43 More revealing of the realities of life in the eighth
century BCE is the Works and Days. Here, we learn that Hesiod’s father had
migrated from the city of Cyme on the coast of Anatolia to the village of
Ascra overlooking the Boeotian plain, where he had been born. It was there
that Hesiod had inherited the plot of land that he was still cultivating for a
living when he wrote his poem. The poet goes on to complain about his
layabout brother, Perses, and the failure of the village authorities to deal
fairly with Hesiod’s complaints against him. All this is couched in the form
of wise advice for fellow farmers, honed by bitter experience.

Much of what Hesiod has to say seems pretty strange to us today: ‘Make
sure you do not stand / Facing the sun when you piss’. (The wind, yes—but
the sun?) His poem also brings vividly to our senses the sheer drudgery and
hardship of eking out a living in what Hesiod, long before modern
archaeologists, was the first to call an ‘age of iron’:
By day, men toil; night worries them with care,
And the gods will give them troubles hard to bear;
…Lacking pity,
With the rule of fist, one sacks another’s city.
It is the same bleak picture that we find in the similes in the epics, but this
time with the added touch of authenticity that comes with Hesiod’s
individual voice. Life in Ascra is presented as a constant struggle against
the elements and unscrupulous neighbours. Winter is so harsh that it ‘bends
an old man into the shape of a hoop’; the summer sun ‘withers the skin’.44
But even while Hesiod was painting this grim picture of life in Boeotia,
conditions in the Greek-speaking world were starting to change, and
rapidly. As the eighth century BCE wore on, the population reached
phenomenal proportions. It has been estimated that in Athens alone, by the
year 720 BCE, the number of inhabitants had multiplied sevenfold over just
two generations. (Ironically, it is from statistical evidence for burials of the
dead that archaeologists have been able to base their estimates for the
number of the living.) The Greeks were not the only people affected.
Several populations around the shores of the Mediterranean seem to have
experienced a similar increase at this time. We don’t know the reason for
this. But the ways in which Greeks responded would define the Greek
world and its people for centuries to come and prepare the ground for the
‘classical’ civilisation that was still some way in the future. With good
reason, the next three centuries would come to be known as an ‘age of
experiment’.45

INVENTING POLITICS, DISCOVERING THE COSMOS
c. 720 BCE–494 BCE

G

reeks were now taking to the seas as never before. From all over the

Greek-speaking world, ships powered by sails and banks of rowers were
heading westwards and southwards across the Mediterranean. Others passed
through the straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus and into the Black
Sea. Once upon a time, according to legends which may go back to
Mycenaean times, Greeks had first ventured into such remote seaways
during the age of heroes. Jason, with his crew of Argonauts, had braved
giants and monsters to bring back the Golden Fleece from today’s Georgia.
Odysseus, in the Odyssey, had travelled to fabulous lands in the west, often
identified as Sicily and even, perhaps, the Strait of Gibraltar. But always, in
those old stories, however far you travelled, your ultimate purpose was to
return to your starting point—enriched if possible, but in any case to arrive
home with a whole skin. The longing for nostos, the Homeric word for
homecoming, was already deeply embedded as a concept in the Greek
language—hence ‘nostalgia’, which means just that.
These new voyages were different. For most of those who embarked,
there was to be no return. But this was not a repeat of the mass migrations
of the ‘dark age’, either. People left their native land in small groups,
determined to carve out new homes for themselves in distant lands. The
Greek word for this kind of settlement abroad was apoikia. The word is
closer in meaning to the English expression ‘a home from home’ than to the
usual translation, ‘colony’. These early Greek settlers were different from
later Roman colonists, and still more from their successors in the age of

European colonialism. Empire building would find a place in the Greek
story in due course, but this was not it.

3. ‘Like ants or frogs around a pond’: Greek settlements in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE

3307

New Greek settlements sprang up all round the coasts of Sicily and
southern Italy. Others formed a line along the southern shore of Europe,
from Catalonia to just short of the French-Italian border. Modern names of
towns and cities often still preserve the memory of their origins in a Greek
settlement: in Italy, Naples (Neapolis) and Taranto (Taras) among many
others; in Catalonia, Empúries, or Ampurias (Emporion); in France,
Marseille (Massalia), Antibes (Antipolis), and Nice (Nicaea). On the coast
of North Africa, there was Cyrene in what is now eastern Libya, Naucratis
on the Nile delta of Egypt. To the east, beyond the Dardanelles, there were
Greek communities to be found on all the shores of the Sea of Marmara and
almost all the way round the Black Sea, including the Sea of Azov. All of
these were in existence by around 600 BCE.1
Two centuries later, the philosopher Plato could put into the mouth of his
teacher, Socrates, the assertion that ‘we [Greeks] live between the River
Phasis and the Pillars of Hercules… making our homes around the sea just
as ants or frogs do around a pond’.2 The River Phasis, now called the Rioni,
flows through Georgia into the Black Sea near its easternmost point. The
Pillars of Hercules were the Strait of Gibraltar. It was some pond.
As Plato had noticed, when Greeks left their homeland to establish
communities abroad, they hardly ever ventured very far from the sea. (This
has often been the case in the modern world, too.) Just like the Mycenaeans
and Minoans before them, the Greeks of the ‘age of experiment’ had the sea
in their blood. It was the sea, and their evident mastery of shipbuilding and
navigation, that enabled so many groups of emigrants to keep in touch with
one another and to prosper by moving goods from one part of that huge
extended coastline to another. Even such notoriously stay-at-home
landlubbers among Greek speakers as the Spartans, when they briefly
joined in at the end of the eighth century, followed the same pattern as
everyone else. At this time, it has been said, ‘a new town was founded in
south Italy or Sicily about every other year’ by Greek settlers.3
What made them do it?
Various explanations have been offered, at different times and from
different perspectives. Perhaps the strongest reason for this unusual pattern
of migration was simply: because they could. Plato’s analogy from the
natural world brings to mind a different sense of the word colony from the

historical one. Species, such as Plato’s ‘ants or frogs’, colonise territory and
maintain themselves there as long as no predators threaten to dislodge them.
The analogy is surprisingly exact for what was happening all around the
shores of the Mediterranean at this time. The only large, centralised,
developed state with a Mediterranean coastline was Egypt. When Greeks
went there, as they did both as mercenaries and as merchants, they did so by
invitation of the pharaoh. That made the single Greek ‘colony’ in Egypt,
Naucratis, a special case, the exception that proves the rule. Anywhere else
on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea, or
the Sea of Azov, you could beach your ship wherever you could find a
sandy shore, put up your tent, and start building your settlement, without
having to ask permission of anyone.
Sometimes the founders of new Greek settlements abroad would have to
fight to establish their territory or to maintain it afterwards. But this
happened surprisingly rarely, at least in the early stages. In the west, the
earliest foundations seem not even to have been fortified. Instead, by
moving into the marginal space between sea and hinterland, the new
arrivals became the entrepreneurs—middlemen or intermediaries—whose
presence and whose skills would enable goods, people, and technological
know-how to pass from one part of the Mediterranean basin to another. For
the time being, the newcomers could bask with impunity. In the absence of
any serious predator, they became part of a new and thriving human
ecology for the whole region.4
The Greeks were not alone in fanning out across the seas at this time. The
Phoenicians had been setting out from their homeland on the Levant coast
for longer and would reach even farther, as far as Cadiz beyond the Strait of
Gibraltar. The Etruscans of the Italian peninsula also established settlements
beyond their own shores. By the year 500 BCE, more than half the entire
coastline of the Mediterranean would be dotted with the settlements of one
or other of these three peoples. And it would be these rival settlers, rather
than the native populations of each hinterland, that for several centuries
would prove to be the Greeks’ strongest competitors.5
All these new settlements naturally started out from small beginnings.
More often than not, the dots they represent on the map do not even join up.
Travel from one to another was invariably by sea, not by land. It may have

been in these circumstances, rather than back home on the Greek mainland
or on the coasts and islands of the Aegean, that Greeks first began to
organise their communities in an entirely new way, one that would go on to
command immense prestige throughout the Greek-speaking world for a
millennium and whose legacy is still with us today. The Greek word for this
kind of community was polis (poleis in the plural), usually translated as
‘city-state’.
Typically, a polis would consist of an urban space, laid out around a
sanctuary and an open area near the centre called an agora. The essential
element of the sanctuary was one or more altars to the patron deity or
deities of the city. Soon, more elaborate buildings would be built as the
homes of these gods and goddesses. The Greek temple, built at first of
wood and later of stone, with its rows of columns and pitched roof ending
in a pediment at either end, was another innovation of the eighth century
BCE. Many still stand as ruins today, and their architectural design would
be copied again and again in later centuries. The agora was at first a
meeting place for the citizens to assemble and only later took on the sense
of ‘market’ (still the everyday meaning of the word in Greek). The city
would be surrounded by an agricultural hinterland of varying size. Farming,
trade, and the spoils of war were the principal sources of wealth.6 City and
hinterland together were ruled from the urban centre. Together, they formed
the equivalent of a political state, as we understand the term today. The
hinterland might include any number of villages or smaller settlements. But
there was, more or less by definition, in each state only one ‘city’.
It seems to have been a function of their size that in these city-states no
institution or social group was consistently strong enough to impose its will
on the rest. For the same reason, there was no given pecking order among
city-states either. There was no equivalent to the Egyptian pharaoh or the
‘Great King’ of Assyria or, later, of Persia to rule by god-given right,
whether within the limits of a single state or as overlord with authority over
many. Later traditions held that poleis such as Athens and Thebes had once
been ruled by hereditary monarchs. But in historical times, of all the Greek
city-states, this was only ever true of Sparta, which was an exceptional case
in many other ways, too. As for a single ruler with power to command all

Greeks, that had only ever been possible in the distant, legendary past,
when Agamemnon was supposed to have led the expedition against Troy.
And even Agamemnon, according to Homer in the Iliad, had had a fractious
time of it, his supremacy seemingly only a temporary response to
circumstances and not immune to challenge or reproach from his peers.
In the absence of the principle of hereditary rule, the only other force that
might have exerted a compelling authority over a polis would have been
religion. The terrifying power of the Olympian gods was everywhere
manifest in nature—in random ‘acts of God’, such as lightning strikes or
earthquakes, for instance. When gods gave orders to humans, whether
through oracles or omens, nobody doubted that they had to be obeyed.
Offerings and sacrifices to the gods, and rituals both private and public,
were an obligatory part of everyday life, as much for individuals as for
whole communities. But in the ancient Greek world there was no religious
hierarchy to dictate or regulate practice or belief. There was no equivalent
to the role of prophet, such as had already emerged in early Judaism or
would later in Islam. No section of Greek society, not even the priesthood,
could command authority on behalf of the divine realm to compare with the
power of popes or bishops or institutions such as the Inquisition during the
Christian Middle Ages.
So, when a group of people came together to organise themselves into a
polis, there was no one to tell them how to do it. They had to work it out for
themselves. Suddenly, everything was up for negotiation and argument.
And this is what Greeks began to do all over the Greek-speaking world both
abroad and at home: to argue, to dispute with one another, to compete to
find the best solutions that would work for the community as a whole, and
then to persuade their peers to adopt them. Out of that combination of
reasoned argument with persuasion would be born the world’s first politics
(literally, ‘the affairs of the polis’).
The philosopher Aristotle, looking back from the perspective of some four
hundred years later in the 330s and 320s BCE, would tell his students in
Athens that the polis represented both the natural and the best way for
human beings to organise themselves into a functioning community. It
existed to ensure for its citizens ‘a perfect and independent life’, ‘that is to
say, for them to live happily and well’.7 In the minds of the ancient Greeks,

it was the concept of the citizen that defined the state, rather than the other
way round. Aristotle was clear that the polis was ‘not a community of
place’. Nor was it merely a means for people to come together for ‘the
reciprocal exercise of justice and exchange’. These things were
consequences of the existence of the polis, not the reason for it, still less its
essence. In official documents and proclamations, a polis would always
define itself not by the name of the city but by the collective name for its
citizens: ‘the Athenians’, ‘the Spartans’, ‘the Thebans’, and so on. For all
these reasons it has been proposed in our own time that a better description
than ‘city-state’ would be ‘citizen-state’.8
On the other hand, the Greek word polis, in its everyday sense, has always
meant simply ‘town or city’. It is true that many of the elements of urban
life as we know it today had not really developed in these early days. Even
the largest poleis were very small by the standards of modern towns, let
alone cities or states. Size was never a defining criterion; the smallest is
said to have contained just 190 inhabitants.9 But to belong to a polis,
whether small or large, has always in Greek been tantamount to what a later
age would call civilisation itself. Aristotle taught his students that anyone
who lived far from cities or who had lived in times before the polis came
into being must be like ‘the man reviled by Homer for being “Out of all
brotherhood, outlawed, homeless”’.10
It may be that the true essence of the polis, and what made it possible, was
neither the place nor its people but the rules that were created specifically
for each place and that bound all the citizens who lived there. It can be no
accident that one of the earliest public uses of the alphabet in the ancient
Greek world was to make laws. These were literally set in stone or bronze,
inscribed in public places where all could see them—even if only a
minority would have been able to read what they said. Probably the oldest
that survives is a fragment preserved at the site of Dreros, in northeastern
Crete, dating from about 650 BCE. Revealingly, the text from Dreros does
not ‘lay down the law’ in the sense that we might expect today. A great deal
of early Greek legislation was about who had the right to exercise particular
forms of authority and in what circumstances. Preoccupations such as these
would dominate the turbulent and often fast-changing lives of most poleis
for the next three hundred years.11

Laws were created for just about every city-state and differed greatly from
one polis to another. Because systems everywhere were being devised from
the ground up, other rules also varied enormously. Names of months,
systems for reckoning historical time, weights, measures, coins (when
coinage was introduced from Anatolia in about 600 BCE), definitions of
citizens’ duties and privileges were different wherever you went. A modern
traveller would have been bewildered passing through the boundaries of so
many separate jurisdictions. And yet the nature of all these rules was
remarkably consistent in all of them.
Out of these systems of rules emerged forms of government. Every polis
had its own constitution, and every constitution was different in points of
detail. One of the tasks Aristotle gave his students was to collect and write
up some 150 of these that were in force in their own day (only the one for
Athens survives). But from at least the first half of the fifth century BCE,
the possible forms of government available to a polis could be reduced to
three broad types: rule by one man, rule by the many, or rule by the few.12
The standard Greek terms for these would soon become established as,
respectively, tyrannis, demokratia, and oligarchia. Precise meanings have
changed a good deal in the intervening two and a half millennia, but all
three are immediately recognisable in the political vocabulary of our own
time.
Back in the preclassical age of experiment, when all of them were first
being tried out, tyranny meant rule by a single strongman, more of a
dictator than necessarily a tyrant in the modern sense. Even tyrants could be
assiduous legislators, sometimes indeed quite progressive by the standards
of their time. By and large, they would abide by their own laws, having
once made them, and often respected those that they had inherited. In an
oligarchy, power was held by a self-chosen elite group, based on birth and
wealth; in a democracy, by the mass of the male citizenry. Irrespective of
the actual system of government, by the end of the sixth century BCE, the
principle had become generally accepted that every citizen was equal before
the law.13
Despite all this, we should not suppose that the ancient polis, as it began
to develop from the seventh century BCE onwards, was everything that
Aristotle and others would later claim for it, particularly when viewed by

the moral and political standards of today. No ancient Greek state was ever
prepared to give full privileges of citizenship to women or more than the
most basic protections to slaves. This meant that those who were entitled to
take part in public affairs could never make up more than between a quarter
and a half of the total adult population. Everywhere, the buying and selling
of human beings as merchandise was an accepted part of civilised life. Wars
between states, more often than not, may have been fought not so much
with the aim of seizing land but of acquiring human capital—in the form of
captives who could then be put to work as slaves.14 These grim realities
were widespread, if not universal, at the time. But they seem never
seriously to have been questioned by the Greeks of the age of experiment,
who made it their business to question so much else about the world in
which they lived and which they were shaping around them.
These were not the only limitations to the ancient polis as the system
worked in practice. Its growth was piecemeal and never spread to the whole
of the Greek-speaking world. So far as we can tell, every new settlement
founded abroad from the end of the eighth century onwards soon adopted
the polis model if it had not done so from the beginning. But many parts of
the Greek mainland lagged behind. These were organised much more
loosely into a type of state known as ethnos (ethne in the plural). This word
had a range of meanings in the ancient language but did not yet signify
what we could call ‘ethnic’ differences because all these communities were
Greek-speaking. An ethnos has been described as ‘a survival of the tribal
system into historical times: a population scattered thinly over a territory
without urban centres’.15 Aristotle was not alone among ancient writers in
regarding ethne as backward, precisely because they lacked the fabric and
institutions that defined the polis. For this reason we know much less about
how they ran their affairs.
In the southern half of Greece, most ethne would in due course coalesce
into distinct poleis over the coming centuries. The farther north you went,
the less likely that was to happen. One ethnos that never did adopt the polis
system was Macedonia. There, hereditary monarchs belonging to a single
dynasty would slowly consolidate their rule over an inland kingdom much
larger than any city-state. The time would come for the kings of Macedonia

to make their mark on world history, as Aristotle and his contemporaries
had good cause to know. But in the meantime, it was the new kind of social
organisation represented by the polis that would define the Greek world.
Among some one thousand five hundred Greek city-states that ever
existed, at various times over a whole millennium, the most famous were
Sparta and Athens. Neither was a typical polis. Sparta was not really a city
at all but a collection of settlements along the banks of the Eurotas River, in
the shadow of Mount Taygetos. Sparta ruled over the territory known as
Laconia, or Lacedaemon, as well as neighbouring Messenia on the far side
of the Taygetos range, which had once been part of the dominion of the
Mycenaean kings of Pylos. All this added up to a Spartan state much larger
than the hinterland of many other poleis put together, comprising roughly
the southern half of the Peloponnese.
The people of Messenia, together with a portion of the native population
of Laconia, were known as ‘helots’, a word which literally means
‘captives’. The helots were the descendants of the indigenous inhabitants,
who according to tradition had been enslaved by the incoming Spartans,
presumably during the upheavals of the dark age. In historical times, the
helots lived in a state of permanent subjection, working in effect as
agricultural serfs. Thanks to slave labour on this scale, Sparta was the only
city-state whose citizens were able to devote themselves full-time to
soldiery. Indeed, a Spartan citizen was forbidden from exercising any sort
of productive profession. Sparta has ever since been remembered as an
intensely corporate, militarised society. One reason for this specialisation
was an understandable fear among their ruling class that one day their
oppressed subjects, who may have outnumbered them by as many as seven
to one, would rise up and take their revenge—as indeed would come to pass
eventually.16
Athens, by contrast, was first and foremost a city. Then, as now, the urban
space was dominated by the imposing rock known as the Acropolis (the
Greek word literally means ‘high city’, and in ancient times just meant a
citadel). Athens controlled a hinterland much smaller than Sparta’s and
smaller even than the modern administrative region which has revived its
ancient name, Attica (or Attiki in modern Greek). But in Athens, unlike in
Sparta, every adult male born within the bounds of the state was a full

citizen. Much of the menial work in and around the city was still done by
slaves, either captured in war or bought in slave markets. But citizens
farmed their own land, or else they earned their living as craftsmen or
traders.17
In a Greek city-state, the law was supreme. And in this, at least, Sparta
and Athens were no exception. Reverence for man-made laws that had been
handed down from legendary figures of the past was as strong in the mind
of an Athenian or a Spartan citizen as his awe (or dread) of the gods. The
Athenian lawgiver Draco has bequeathed to us the word draconian;
Lycurgus of Sparta most probably never existed, but his name would remain
inseparably attached to the rigid Spartan system of laws. Beyond that
common ground, the constitutional systems of the two states were about as
different as it was possible to be.
Sparta was the only Greek polis to retain a traditional, hereditary
monarchy. Even more unusual was that two kings, belonging to separate
dynasties, always ruled together. Exactly where the balance of power lay in
Sparta between the kings, at one end of the spectrum, and citizens’
assemblies, at the other, is not entirely clear. Women in Sparta had a higher
social status and more of a voice than women in most other city-states;
unlike in Athens, they could even own property, though they had no voice
in citizen assemblies. But in every other respect, Spartan society was
intensely conservative. Having established their laws and their constitution
in (probably) the seventh century BCE, the Spartans would resolutely stick
to them for centuries thereafter. Whenever they looked beyond their own
borders, the form of government they liked to see in neighbouring states
was oligarchy. But the Spartans’ own system was like no other.18
In Athens, on the other hand, the balance of power was continually
shifting, and the Athenian constitution had to evolve to keep pace. By 500
BCE, Athens had experienced each of the three possible types of
government that the polis system had thrown up: oligarchy at first, tyranny
in the second half of the sixth century, and then finally an early form of
democracy. The precise mechanisms that enabled the mass of the people
(demos) to take power (kratos) have been much discussed. The information
that has come down to us is incomplete and often distorted by later biases.

The last tyrant of Athens, Hippias, was expelled in 510 BCE—by an army
from Sparta which seems to have been trying to meddle in internal
Athenian politics. In the ensuing turmoil, one of the rival factions in Athens
promised ‘power to the people’ in return for popular support. Quite how or
why it worked we do not know for sure. But the fact is that it did.
Cleisthenes, the leader of the winning faction, went on to introduce a farreaching set of reforms. Another half century would pass before the
Athenian constitution would become fully democratic and the word itself
was coined. But however opaque its origins, the world’s first functioning
democracy is usually said to have been created in Athens during the years
508–507 BCE.19
Every polis, from Athens and Sparta down to the smallest, was fiercely
jealous of its autonomy. The Greek word autonomia was coined in the fifth
century BCE and originally referred to the freedom of the state to make its
own laws. It also meant that no state could legislate beyond its own borders
without encroaching on the autonomy of another. Relations among
independent, self-governing poleis were as much open to competition,
negotiation, and argument as were those among citizens and groups within
each one of them. But the Greeks of the ancient world never did find a
satisfactory way to regulate these relationships, one that would have been
comparable to the invention of ‘politics’ within the polis.
On the occasions when city-states did work together, it was usually in
temporary alliances for mutual self-protection. To justify these
arrangements, Greeks liked to appeal to shared ancestry. But the evidence
suggests that most, if not all, stories about distant ancestors were invented
after the fact. Settlements that could trace their foundation back to a
‘mother city’ (metropolis) in the Greek heartland might draw on that city in
later times for support—or commonly, in practice, vice versa. But this only
highlights the remarkable degree of independence enjoyed by even small
and far-flung poleis. There was never any expectation that a mother city
would exercise any form of political control over ‘its own’ foundations
abroad; whenever a metropolis tried, it usually ended badly. That is one
more reason why the term colony, with its associations of wars of

independence and twentieth-century decolonisation, is so badly suited to
describe a Greek apoikia.20
A looser basis for alliances could sometimes be the three main dialects
(strictly speaking, groups of dialects) that made up the Greek-speaking
world. Western Greek dialects (also, confusingly, spoken throughout the
southern Aegean, including Crete and the southernmost parts of the
Anatolian coast) were known as Doric. On the eastern side of the Aegean,
but also in Athens, the Ionic group was spoken. Aeolic was spoken farther
north, mainly in the northern Aegean islands, the northern Aegean coast of
what is now Turkey, and the Greek coast and its hinterland from Thessaly
southwards as far as Boeotia. A convenient mythology identified the
speakers of each dialect as the descendants of a common ancestor and gave
them collective names: Dorians, Ionians, and Aeolians. It was among Ionic
speakers that the first attempt at building a political confederacy was made,
perhaps as early as the seventh century BCE. A sanctuary called the
Panionion (meaning ‘All-Ionian’, or ‘Of All Ionians’) served as a meeting
point for representatives from a dozen city-states in western Anatolia. Not
to be outdone, the Aeolians farther north seem to have set up something
similar.21 On the other side of the Aegean, the Spartans would often exploit
their supposed kinship with other Doric-speaking states to claim a leading
role among them.
Despite these partial exceptions, the default position for every city-state
was complete autonomy for its citizen body, at all times and at all costs.
Citizens expected they would have to fight to maintain it. ‘The battlements
of a polis are its fighting men,’ memorably declared the poet Alcaeus,
writing on the island of Lesbos in the late seventh century BCE. And
Aristotle, three hundred years later, though he accepted that human beings
could be enslaved, could not imagine the same for a polis. ‘It would be
unthinkable,’ he said, ‘to give the name of polis to something that was by
nature enslaved, since a polis is independent and the condition of a slave is
not.’22
And so, as rival states fought to maintain their much-prized freedom from
each other, the polis system brought about a revolution in the Greek way of
war. Homer’s heroes had fought in chaotic hand-to-hand encounters
between self-declared champions, who drove to and from the field in

chariots. In the new kind of warfare, lines of heavily armoured infantrymen,
known as ‘hoplites’, faced each other in phalanxes (we still use the same
word). Each member of the phalanx was protected on one side by the shield
of his neighbour. If you fought in a phalanx, your survival in battle would
depend on the man next to you (unless you were unfortunate enough to be
on the end of the line). It was a tactic that would dismay enemies whose
forces were very much larger. And it worked because hoplite armies were
above all citizen armies. At the same time, new, larger, and faster ships were
being designed and built. These were crewed by banks of oarsmen who had
literally to pull together in order to ram an enemy. Once again, in battle the
survival of one depended on the combined actions of all.23
For hundreds of years, war was endemic among Greek city-states. Mutual
suspicion was the norm. ‘Autonomy’ was the prize. These were all-ornothing, zero-sum struggles, with no quarter given. And yet all these people
spoke the same language. The differences among dialects were never
enough to make one speaker incomprehensible to another. They all feared
and begged favours from the same gods and in much the same ways
(though there were plenty of local variations, too). By the sixth century
BCE, the quarrelsome family of immortals described by Homer had
expanded to become the ‘twelve Olympians’, whose names and attributes
were now widespread, if not yet quite universal throughout the Greekspeaking world.
Zeus was king and often called the ‘father’ of the others—although
Poseidon was his brother and Hera, his queen, was also his sister. Apart
from Zeus, each had a special sphere of influence: Poseidon ruled over the
sea and was responsible for earthquakes. Athena was the goddess of
wisdom, Aphrodite of sexual love, Apollo of light and poetry, though the
arrows fired from his bow were notoriously deadly. Ares personified war,
Dionysus the emotions and intoxication, Hermes trickery. A city would
boast a patron deity, in some ways the equivalent of a patron saint in later
times; the best-known case is Athena as the protectress of Athens. But
sometimes the worship of particular gods would become attached to places
that were, politically speaking, in the middle of nowhere. And this is how a
network grew up of religious sanctuaries that drew worshippers from every

corner of the Greek world, in the process cutting right across the
fragmented world of the poleis and the more loosely organised ethne.24
One of these was on the tiny island of Delos in the middle of the
Cyclades, the birthplace, according to legend, of Apollo and his twin sister,
the virgin huntress Artemis. Another, perched on a steep mountainside on
the flank of the Parnassus massif in central Greece, was at Delphi. There,
Apollo would answer the questions put to him by mortals through his
infallible but often inscrutable oracle. Olympia, the third, lay on the bank of
a shallow river among the wooded hills of the northwest Peloponnese and
was dedicated to Zeus, the king of Olympus. From small beginnings,
religious centres at all three would expand their influence over several
centuries.25
Regular festivals dedicated to the gods worshipped at each of these
sanctuaries provided a mechanism for the elites of city-states that most of
the rest of the time were at war with one another to meet, argue and
negotiate, display their prowess, and vie for prestige.26 This was the origin
of the ritualised tests of physical strength and skill that would become the
forerunners of modern athletics (needless to say, another Greek word, from
a root meaning originally ‘to struggle’ or ‘to compete’). The games held
every four years at Olympia were said to have been established in the year
776 BCE (according to our system of counting). From that time on, the
Olympic Games would be a regular fixture in the ancient world for over a
thousand years.
During the period of the Games, and for an interval on either side, an
‘Olympic truce’ was declared so that competitors and sponsors could travel
freely. All states that sent competitors were obliged to respect this truce—
the clearest indication, surely, that the organisers recognised these festivals
as a benign surrogate for war.27 Competitors and spectators travelled by sea
from the ends of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and by land from the
mountainous hinterland as far north as Macedonia—then an outlandish
place in the eyes of other Greeks. Numbers may have been modest at first.
But when the stadium at Olympia was enlarged in the fifth century BCE, it
could accommodate a crowd of forty thousand.
By that time, athletic contests had been established as part of regular
religious festivals at other sanctuaries too. One of these, at Delphi, was

known as the Pythian Games. Another was at Isthmia near Corinth, on the
isthmus that joins the Peloponnese to the rest of the Greek peninsula; the
fourth, at Nemea in the northern Peloponnese.28 A Greek-speaking world
was emerging that was at once thoroughly interconnected and deeply
fragmented. What kept it fragmented was the autonomy of each polis.
Delos, Delphi, and Olympia were the nodes through which connections
were channelled.
It was from these religious centres, too, and hesitantly at first, that there
began to spread the first stirrings of a shared sense of identity as ‘Hellenes’.
Originally, this had been the name of a small group living in the kingdom of
the legendary Achilles. The name ‘Hellas’, which in the Iliad had defined a
region within that small kingdom, expanded in meaning to cover
everywhere that Hellenes, that is to say, Greek speakers, lived. But this kind
of collective consciousness was most probably still in its infancy as late as
500 BCE. And in any case, it was a far cry from anything that could be
called political cooperation, let alone unity.29
While the age of experiment lasted, Greeks were discovering themselves
and their place in the world in a variety of other ways, too. New generations
of poets composed and performed verses that for the first time brought into
the public domain intimate aspects of what it feels like to be human. We
know the work of these poets only through quotations by later writers or
from chance finds of papyri in the Egyptian desert—which show that some
of these poets, at least, were still being read a millennium after their
lifetime. So far as we can tell, their poems were mostly short and designed
to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument. This is why both
the poems and their composers have come to be known as ‘lyric’, from the
plucked lyre. Many of these poets evoke the joys of wine, the effects of age
on hope and desire, the cattiness of envy, and the trading of insults—
everyday concerns caught in language of sudden immediacy. In the middle
of the seventh century BCE, Archilochus, from the island of Paros in the
Cyclades, captured in elegant verse the anatomical details as well as the
sensations involved in what sounds like a session of group sex.30
Most famous of all was Sappho of Lesbos. Her life seems to have spanned
the decades on either side of the year 600 BCE. She it was whose

evocations of love and sex between women and girls long ago gave the
world the word lesbian. In many Greek city-states, male homosexuality,
particularly between middle-aged men and adolescent boys, was an
accepted adjunct to the education curriculum and often praised ahead of
heterosexual love.31 In Lesbos, the same applied to women. But it was not
the local attitude to homosexuality, whether female or male, that made the
island of Lesbos exceptional in the ancient Greek world. It was not even,
probably, the fact that it was possible for women and young girls to come
together in some kind of social setting, just as men did. What was
extraordinary was that the poems Sappho composed and sang made it into
writing, and so established a literary reputation that ever since has far
outstripped the circle of her actual readers.
Sappho’s poems radiate a sense of joyous self-discovery. For once, the
preoccupations of warriors, male athletes, and the competing male citizens
of the polis are put roundly in their place:
Some think a fleet, a troop of horse
or soldiery the finest sight
in all the world; but I say, what one loves.
Observing a young girl flirting with a man, Sappho is so taken with the
girl’s beauty that she vicariously shares in the physiological response of her
lover:
speech fails me,
my tongue is paralysed, at once
a light fire runs beneath my skin,
my eyes are blinded, and my ears drumming,
the sweat pours down me, and I shake
all over, sallower than grass:
I feel as if I’m not far off dying.32
Still, for all the startling intimacy of these poems, written more than two
and a half millennia ago, there is nothing in early Greek lyric of the private
introspection that we often associate with ‘lyrical’ poetry in later times. So
far as we can tell, these poets performed their works before an audience.

Often this would be a close-knit group, gathered in a private house to eat
and drink together, in what was called a symposium. Other occasions were
more public, sometimes involving a whole choir of performers. Even if the
circle of listeners was quite small, the physical presence of others and the
act of performance were essential to the poem’s conception and
composition. So, too, must have been the responses, though of course these
have not been recorded. The presence in the poems of real individuals, who
may well have been part of the audience and who even had a ‘right of reply’
in their turn, anchors the intimate and the personal in an immediate,
tangible community of equals.
In the visual arts, beginning a little before the lifetime of Sappho, Greek
towns and cities became peopled with stone or bronze replicas of their
citizens. Life-sized or slightly larger statues started appearing in great
numbers in sanctuaries and graveyards all over the Greek-speaking world.
A similar figure, erected inside a temple to represent the god or goddess
worshipped there, might be up to four times natural size. But most
represented ordinary citizens. In graveyards, the stone effigies of the dead
stood tall, stark naked if they had been men, decorously draped if they had
been women. Every one of them stared straight ahead at the viewer, as they
still do in museums today, every one of them still smiling the same
enigmatic smile, and always, eternally young.
The technology and the techniques of execution came from Egypt. The
Egyptians had been raising monumental statues in their temples and royal
palaces for centuries. But even if the earliest Greek statues ‘look’ Egyptian,
the uses to which Greek sculptors put the newly learned technology were all
their own. Human statues in ancient Egypt were made to overawe the
viewer with the power of the pharaoh. But there was no one with that kind
of status in a Greek polis. Not even a ‘tyrant’ could impose himself on his
fellow citizens so blatantly. Greek gods, too, looked quite different from the
strange hybrid forms of Egyptian gods: part human, part animal or bird.
When the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus began to take form in
stone or bronze, they were always entirely human—just as they are
described in the Homeric epics. Greeks worshipped superior beings who
looked and behaved just like immortal versions of themselves. And their

better-off citizens were prepared to go to great trouble and expense to have
their own selves, and their loved ones, represented in the same way.33
Today, the statues that represent citizens are known respectively by the
ancient Greek words for a boy or young man (kouros, plural kouroi) and for
a girl or young woman (kore, plural korai). The poses are unnatural, the
proportions derived as much from geometry as from anatomy. Even the
famous ‘archaic smile’ has been explained in terms of the ‘difficulties of
carving the transition from mouth to cheek’.34 Whether they were carved
from shining white marble or from duller limestone or sandstone, the finish
included paint for hair, eyes, and the drapery of the korai in colours that by
modern standards would probably seem garish. Quite how the flesh of the
naked males would have appeared is harder to tell. According to a very
ancient convention, begun by the Egyptians and followed by the Minoans
and Mycenaeans in their time, men’s skin was represented by a reddishbrown pigment, women’s by white. The assumption, in later times, that
ancient Greek art had established an ideal of the white male body is
sometimes still repeated. But it is not based in fact.
Neither the sculptors of this period nor the patrons who commissioned
them as yet had any great interest in trying to reproduce the likeness of an
individual—any more than the lyric poets spoke of truly private experience.
On the other hand, behind the standardised poses and the fixed, enigmatic
smiles, there is something individual about many of those creations. This is
where the new technology of stone- and bronze-working meets the only
slightly older technology of alphabetic writing. An early male figurine from
Thebes, cast in bronze and evidently commissioned as an offering meant to
stand in a temple courtyard, bears the words, in verse, carved into its legs:
Manticlus dedicated me to the far-shooter, silver-bowed god [i.e.,
Apollo],
As a tithe. Phoebus [Apollo], provide a gift in return.
There is something touchingly transactional about this attempt to negotiate
with the divine, which the modern term piety doesn’t come near to
capturing. You give the god an expensive present—and you don’t just hope
or pray, you ask him outright for a favour in return.35

In a graveyard, it was the statue itself, and not the dead person it was
supposed to represent, who was imagined as speaking in the inscription:
‘Marker of Phrasikleia. I shall ever be called maiden, the gods allotting me
this title in place of marriage: Aristion of Paros made me.’ It is the absence
of a loved person that the ‘marker’ perpetuates. The statue itself, standing
dignified and holding between her breasts what appears to be a flower,
perhaps the virginity that was never ‘plucked’, both speaks to us and looks
at us.36
By the end of the sixth century BCE, then, Greeks were using both words
and images to put down markers of who they were. And it wasn’t only in
solemn, public spaces that this was happening. Within the home, too,
citizens were getting used to seeing images of their own kind reproduced—
on the plates, cups, and mixing bowls that they handled daily. During the
sixth century BCE, work produced by the potters and vase painters of two
Greek cities, first Corinth and then Athens, was in demand all over the
Greek-speaking world and even beyond. Some of the images displayed on
these prized objects were of monsters or of fantastic hybrids, creatures of
legend such as satyrs (half-man, half-goat), Egyptian sphinxes (a human
face on the body of a lion), and centaurs (half-man, half-horse). But mostly
they were images of male humans. Women are not absent but tend to appear
only in the guise of goddesses or famous characters from legend. And the
same dress code used on statues was usually, though not invariably, applied
on painted pots.37 It was the image of the Greek male, painted in profile
with jutting chin, beard, and not infrequently, erect penis, too, that by the
end of the century had become part of the furniture, in daily use all over the
Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts.
This was an artform so taken for granted by everyone who ever dined and
drank at a symposium that it earned barely a single mention in the work of
any ancient Greek author.38 For us today, these paintings in their thousands,
recovered whole from graves or painstakingly reassembled by
archaeologists from broken household crockery, offer fascinating glimpses
into what it must have felt like to be Greek in the sixth century BCE and
into the ways that Greek speakers of that time saw and thought about
themselves.

In these images, naked athletes show off their prowess, flexing their
muscles or wrestling an opponent to the ground, just as they did daily in
exercise grounds in cities and sanctuaries all over the Greek-speaking
world. Soldiers appear in full armour, topped by the forbidding bronze
helmet of a type that survives in many museum exhibits today, with the
prominent nose guard that leaves only narrow spaces for the wearer to see
out. Another favourite type of scene shows animals being brought to
sacrifice in a sacred grove or in front of a temple. Drinking vessels often
show diners reclining and enjoying food, wine, and conversation at a
symposium, the setting in which many of these objects would have been
used.
More surprising to modern tastes, and shocking to earlier generations of
classicists, are the scenes of courtship and sex. Some show gifts being
offered as a preliminary to a tryst. Usually, these feature an older man and a
younger man, though sometimes girls appear as well. Others depict sex acts
between men, often with sufficient realism to suggest that the participants
are thoroughly enjoying themselves.39 It seems that the activities celebrated
by poets such as Archilochus were in vogue as subjects to be represented on
household crockery for use in smart homes. This was another way in which
Greek society of this early period liked to look at itself—and successfully
promoted the resulting images among not just its own members but
outsiders too.
Greeks at this time were also looking outward at the world around them.
The study of ‘Nature’ (Physis, giving us our word physics) would lay the
foundation for much of modern science. Egyptians and Babylonians had
already, for centuries, been probing the mysteries of the heavens and
investigating the properties of numbers and shapes. Greeks who lived in
cities on the Anatolian coast probably had the best access to these older
discoveries. One of these cities, Miletus, was the home of the first Greeks to
make a systematic study of them. Beginning about 600 BCE, Thales,
Anaximenes, and Anaximander, all from Miletus, began to expound
theories and discoveries of their own to explain the visible universe.
Before long, they and their successors in many different parts of the Greek
world would come to be known by the Greek term philosophoi, which

literally means ‘lovers of wisdom’. They were the first philosophers. But
they were also, because ‘wisdom’ was not compartmentalised in those days,
the first scientists and the first mathematicians. Exactly how much they
learned from the older civilisations of the Near and Middle East is debated
today. What is not in doubt is that they invented an entirely new method,
which lies at the root of all these disciplines as they have developed ever
since. The method derives directly from the politics of the polis. In the same
way that citizens argued about what we still call ‘policy’, philosophers
constructed logical arguments that started from the evidence of the visible
world in order to probe underlying causes. And in this way was born the
concept, central to all mathematics and science, of proof.40
It can be hard to reconstruct in detail what these early philosophers
thought and what they achieved; their writings have been preserved only in
fragments, through the quotations of other, much later writers, who usually
had their own philosophical axe to grind. The little we know about their
careers shows that many of them took full advantage of the general mobility
at the time. Pythagoras of Samos, in the later sixth century BCE, went all
the way to Croton, in today’s Calabria, to found what would become known
as a ‘school’ of mathematics. Xenophanes, originally from Colophon, an
Ionian city not far from Ephesus on the Aegean coast of Anatolia, is said to
have travelled all over the Greek world from about 570 BCE during a life
that spanned almost a century. Xenophanes was a poet as much as a
philosopher and it is not clear how systematic his thinking may have been.
He was the first Greek we know of to break with the traditional stories
about the gods of Olympus and to argue instead that ‘there is one god,
greatest among gods and men, similar to mortals neither in shape nor in
thought’. It was a very human error, he declared, to suppose that the gods
look like ourselves: if cows, horses, or lions could draw shapes, he posited,
they would draw their gods in the shape of cows, horses, or lions.41
Back on the Anatolian coast, Heraclitus of Ephesus was active during the
decades either side of 500 BCE. He may have been the first to articulate the
idea that the universe can be explained in terms of fixed laws, the natural
equivalent of the laws that governed the Greek city-state. According to
Heraclitus, the cosmos in which we all live had been created by ‘none of the
gods or men… but it always was and is and shall be: an ever-living fire,

kindling in measures and going out in measures’. This is the earliest known
use of the Greek word cosmos in the sense that it still has in many
languages today, equivalent to ‘the universe’. The original meaning of the
word is ‘order’ or ‘arrangement’.42 Implicit in what Heraclitus says, then, is
the idea that the natural universe is rationally ordered, even though no
rational being created it. And its processes are governed by ‘measures’—
meaning, in Greek as in English today, a regularity that is capable of being
measured. Modern science begins with Heraclitus of Ephesus.
For as long as no serious predator existed to threaten them, the ‘ants or
frogs’ remained perfectly content to thrive, prosper, and fight among
themselves around their pond. This state of affairs lasted for almost two
hundred years. But in the middle of the sixth century BCE, predators for the
first time appeared on the scene. In the east, Croesus, the fabulously rich
king of Lydia, from his capital at Sardis expanded the bounds of his
kingdom until it drew in all the Greek settlements of western Anatolia
during the decade between 560 and 550 BCE. In the west, Carthage,
originally a Phoenician settlement in what is now Tunisia, had become the
nucleus of a powerful local kingdom and was beginning to threaten the
Greek cities of Sicily.43 But those threats were as nothing compared to the
sudden emergence of the empire of the Medes and Persians under its king,
Kurash, known in Greek as Cyrus, who came to the throne in 559 BCE.
During a reign of thirty years, Cyrus extended Persian control from the
Aegean Sea to the Caspian and far to the east into modern Afghanistan and
Pakistan. His successor, Cambyses II, would conquer Egypt, the two-and-ahalf-thousand-year-old kingdom of the pharaohs, to create the largest, most
centralised empire the world had yet seen. And after Cyrus defeated the
Lydians under Croesus in 546 BCE, one by one the Greek cities of Anatolia
were brought under Persian rule.44 A whole slice of the shore around the
pond had been gobbled up. What were the Greek communities to do?
One solution was to remember past mobility and up sticks once more.
According to the historian Herodotus, writing in Athens about a century
after the events he describes, the people of the coastal city of Phocaea
(today’s Foça, in the Izmir province of Turkey), under cover of night:

launched their galleys, put aboard their women and children and
moveable property, including the statues and other sacred objects from
their temples—everything, in fact, except paintings, and images made of
bronze or marble—and sailed for Chios.… They also dropped a lump of
iron into the sea and swore never to return to Phocaea until it floated up
again.
The nearby island of Chios was only a temporary stopping place. The
fleeing Phocaeans went on to build a new city, far away in Corsica. But
after several decades, under mounting pressure from Carthaginians and
Etruscans, they had to abandon it and moved to the toe of Italy instead,
where many Greek settlements were already thriving. In the new world of
the late sixth century BCE, the free-and-easy mobility of an earlier time was
no longer a reliable solution.
Herodotus devotes several pages to the defiance of the Phocaeans. But he
notes only one other example. Everywhere else, the Greek cities of Anatolia
submitted to their new overlords.45 Persian rule was devolved to regional
potentates known as ‘satraps’ (soon to become a dirty word in Greek, as it
still is to this day). The satraps, in turn, were content to allow the Greek
city-states to manage their internal affairs, provided they stayed loyal. The
Greeks who benefited the most from this arrangement seem to have been
the elites. Prominent men and leading families vied with one another to
secure the backing of the satrap, or of the Great King himself, in order to
exercise the role of tyrant in their city. Some humbler Greeks even migrated
in the opposite direction from the Phocaeans, to wind up as labourers or
artisans in the Persian capital, Persepolis.46
First to wake up to the new threat, on the western side of the Aegean, was
Sparta. At some point in the 540s BCE, while the Persians under Cyrus
were seizing one Greek city-state in western Anatolia after another, the
Spartans sent a delegation to the Great King: if he didn’t desist at once, they
would take it upon themselves to intervene to protect their fellow Greeks.
As the story is told by Herodotus, Cyrus had never heard of Sparta and had
to prevail on his Greek subjects to explain who these people were who
thought they could threaten him. In any case, nothing more came of it. For

the next half century, the Spartans concentrated their military efforts against
other Greek city-states on their own side of the Aegean.47
By the final decade of the sixth century BCE, a combination of military
conquest and asymmetrical treaties had brought most of the Peloponnese
under the domination of Sparta. Spartan phalanxes began to venture across
the Isthmus of Corinth. This was how the last tyrant of Athens, Hippias,
came to be expelled from the city by a Spartan army. Two years later, the
democratic reforms begun by Cleisthenes were proving even less to the
liking of the Spartans than the tyrant had been. In 506, the Spartan hoplites
were back at the gates of Athens, this time demanding the expulsion of
Cleisthenes. In a moment of desperation, the Athenians turned to the new
rising power in the east. The Great King of the Medes and Persians was
now Daryaush, known to the Greeks as Darius I. Would he help them out?
It is once again Herodotus who tells the story. The satrap who interviewed
the Athenian envoys was as bemused as Cyrus two generations earlier had
been by the Spartans. The answer was only to be expected: ‘If the
Athenians would signify their submission by the usual gift of earth and
water, then Darius would make a pact with them; otherwise, they had better
go home.’ By the time the envoys returned to Athens, having made the
necessary act of submission, the Spartan troops had gone home, too. With
the immediate threat withdrawn, the city’s democratic rulers were not best
pleased to be told what their envoys had done in their name. But nobody
ever got round to rescinding the formal acknowledgement of Persian
overlordship.48
Then, in 499 BCE, after almost half a century of subjection, revolt broke
out in Miletus. Its immediate target was probably not so much the Persians
directly as those local Greek elites who relied on Persian favour. Other
Ionian cities of the Anatolian seaboard joined in. Thus began the one brief
moment of glory for the confederacy known as the Panionion. The Ionians
sent desperate messages for help to the free city-states on the western side
of the Aegean. Sparta refused. But the Athenians offered a small contingent,
even though Athens was not yet a naval power, had few ships to spare, and
was still, technically, a Persian vassal. Support also came from the tiny citystate of Eretria in southern Euboea. Once the rebels and their allies had
assembled at Miletus, they sailed north along the coast to Ephesus,

disembarked, and marched upcountry to Sardis, the former capital of the
Lydian kingdom and the present seat of the local Persian satrap. They failed
to take the fortress but instead set fire to the city before retreating to the
coast. There they were routed by a Persian counterattack. This was enough
for the Athenians and the Eretrians, who abandoned the campaign and
sailed for home.49
It seems that the rebels were poorly led and had no clearly defined
objectives. Even so, the Ionians carried on, without external help, for five
years. Defeat came finally in the sea battle of Lade, off Miletus, when the
combined navies of the rebel city-states faced an even larger fleet of
warships mustered by the Persians from their Phoenician subjects. The
reprisals ordered by the Persian king, Darius, were horrific. As Herodotus
tells the tale:
Once the towns were in their hands, the best-looking boys were chosen
for castration and made into eunuchs; the most beautiful girls were
dragged from their homes and sent to Darius’ court, and the towns
themselves, temples and all, were burnt to the ground.
The last item is amply confirmed by the archaeological record, which
shows that parts of Miletus were destroyed so thoroughly that they were
never rebuilt.50 By the time the ‘Ionian Revolt’ was over, in the summer of
494 BCE, Darius had thoroughly consolidated his grip on western Anatolia
and was beginning to look farther afield. Already, Persian power was
reaching across the Hellespont and would soon extend westwards through
Thrace and into Macedonia.
The Athenians and Eretrians had achieved nothing by their intervention—
other than to make themselves noticed. According to an anecdote reported
by Herodotus, when news of the burning of Sardis reached Darius, he had
first to ask who the Athenians were. On being told, the story continues, the
Great King of the Medes and Persians reached immediately for his bow and
shot an arrow into the air, crying aloud, ‘Grant, O God, that I may punish
the Athenians.’ Like so many of Herodotus’s stories, this one is probably
too good to be true. The same can be said of the sequel—that from that time
onwards, Darius had a servant repeat to him three times before he sat down
to dinner each day, ‘Master, remember the Athenians.’51 But by 494 BCE,

the new predator on their doorstep most definitely had the Greek city-states
to the west of the Aegean in his sights.

4
THE FIRST WORLD WARS AND THE ‘CLASSICAL’ AGE
494 BCE–404 BCE

I

t is entirely characteristic of the Greek world of independent city-states

that during the very years when the Persians were preparing to move
against them, both Sparta and Athens were engaged in bitter fighting on
their respective doorsteps. In the summer of 494 BCE, at the same moment
that the Persians crushed the last Greek resistance on the eastern side of the
Aegean, the Spartans came the nearest they had done, yet, to knocking out
the only rival that still stood out against them in the Peloponnese. This was
Argos, the inheritor of the Mycenaean kingdoms of Mycenae and Tiryns,
whose conical hill surmounted by a medieval castle is still a conspicuous
landmark, not far from today’s Nafplio. Spartan troops under King
Cleomenes failed to take the city but killed most of its men of fighting age
by setting fire to a wood in which they had taken refuge.
Athens at the same time had been locked for several decades in conflict
with neighbouring Thebes to the north and with the island of Aegina to the
south. Thebes, today a small market town, is less than an hour’s drive from
central Athens. Aegina can be reached in an even shorter time from the port
of Piraeus. And yet in the early fifth century BCE, this island was home to a
prosperous and proudly independent seafaring people, who were viciously
at odds with the gentlemen farmers of Attica. Deadly though these local
struggles were, their scale was tiny when set beside the looming threat from
the largest empire in the world.1

4. The Persian Wars (490 BCE–479 BCE)

3307

As the fateful year of 490 BCE approached, both Athens and Sparta were
also riven by internal dissensions. In the case of Sparta, these were serious
enough to rock the very foundations of the state. The two kings, who
according to Spartan custom ruled jointly, Cleomenes and Demaratus, had
been at one another’s throats for over twenty years. In 491 BCE, in effect,
each moved to depose the other. The upshot was that Demaratus fled to
Persian-controlled Anatolia. There, he was rewarded with a gift of lands
and a position of trust by Darius. Within a year, Cleomenes had allegedly
gone mad and is supposed to have committed suicide in prison, although it
is more probable that he was murdered.2 In Athens, tensions were not quite
so high but still sufficient to threaten the stability of the state’s new and still
very experimental democracy. Memories of the deposed tyrants ran deep—
and were perhaps also deliberately blackened by those who had most to lose
should they return. Hippias was still alive; like his Spartan counterpart
Demaratus, he was thriving under the protection of the Great King of
Persia. For both cities, a Persian victory would be likely to bring back their
own discredited rulers as compliant satraps.
In the same year, 491 BCE, Darius sent envoys to all the Greek city-states
on the western side of the Aegean, inviting them to send the ritual gift of
earth and water that would bind them as his vassals. Most complied. But at
Athens the Persian emissaries ‘were thrown into the pit like criminals. At
Sparta they were pushed into a well—and told that if they wanted earth and
water for the king, to get them from there’.3
After this defiance, a Persian fleet set sail from Anatolia in 490 BCE. In
command were the satraps Datis and Artaphernes. From Samos in the
eastern Aegean, the ships headed west, through the archipelago. Eretria and
Athens, the cities that had taken part in the Ionian Revolt, were among the
first targets. Eretria was destroyed after a short siege. It was then to be the
turn of Athens. The Persians were guided by local knowledge obligingly
provided by Hippias, the former tyrant, who travelled along with them as an
honoured guest. The expedition landed in the wide sandy bay of Marathon,
on the coast of Attica nearest to Euboea. The plain of Marathon was ideal
terrain for the Persian cavalry. Against them stood the Athenian citizen
army, drawn up in a phalanx and supported by a small contingent from the
Boeotian town of Plataea. When they knew that the Persian landing was

imminent, the Athenians had sent a runner to Sparta to appeal for
reinforcements. Pheidippides, the runner, covered the distance of almost
150 miles in under two days—despite which the Spartans found a pretext to
delay their arrival until after the battle was over.4
Commanded by a general named Miltiades, who had seen service against
the Persians during the Ionian Revolt, the Athenian hoplites charged the
much larger Persian force at a run. By day’s end, the Persians had retreated
in disarray to their ships and were desperately pushing out to sea. Precisely
192 Athenians lost their lives in the battle, according to Herodotus. They
were buried with full honours under a mound which today rises some forty
feet above the plain of Marathon. A smaller number of Plataean dead were
similarly honoured. An exact count of the Persian forces and their losses
will never be known. Herodotus claimed six thousand four hundred were
killed.
But the Persian fleet had escaped intact. The ships were already on their
way round Cape Sounion. They could be expected to reach Phaleron, at that
time the port of Athens, the next day. The entire Athenian army was
camped at Marathon. If the Persians were to reach Athens first, there would
be no one to stop them taking the city. There was nothing for it but a forced
march over the shoulder of Mount Pentelikon, back to Athens. The hoplites
covered the distance, reckoned at twenty-six miles by the shortest route,
presumably still carrying their full kit, and arrived before the fleet was yet
in sight. It was in emulation of this feat that the marathon race, named after
the battle site, would be devised and run for the first time when the Olympic
Games were revived in Athens in 1896.5
By the time the Persian ships reached Phaleron, it was too late for a
surprise attack on Athens. They lay at anchor offshore for a few days, no
doubt gazing at the temples crowning the Acropolis, clearly visible in the
distance, and watching the manoeuvres of the Athenian hoplites on the
plain between. Then Datis gave the order, and the ships set sail, back to the
Anatolian coast. The first attempt by the Persian Empire to extend itself into
the western side of the Aegean had ended ignominiously.
It would take the Persians a full ten years to regroup and try again. Quite
how the Spartan dual monarchy and the Athenian emerging democracy

made use of the respite is a little mysterious. Sparta had two new, untried
kings, who would have had their hands full rebuilding trust in the system
after the debacle of 491–490 BCE. Leotychidas II had to live down the
awkward fact that his predecessor and kinsman Demaratus was still alive
and well, living in Anatolia as the guest of the Great King of Persia.
Leonidas I, married to the daughter of the disgraced Cleomenes, would
become a household name only at the very end of his ten-year reign. Along
with the citizens’ committees to which they were to some extent
accountable, the Spartan kings would have been as watchful as ever of the
domestic threat posed by the enslaved helots at home and their still defiant
neighbours in Argos.6
In Athens, the new democratic institutions were struggling to cope with
renewed internal tensions. A remarkable innovation, seemingly intended as
a kind of safety valve, was tried out for the first time two years after the
victory at Marathon. On a given day, every citizen was invited to inscribe
on a discarded piece of broken pot the name of someone he wanted to see
exiled from the city for the next ten years. The practice became known as
‘ostracism’, from the Greek word for the sherd on which the names were
written or painted (ostrakon). Many of these primitive voting slips survive
today, along with the evidence that vote rigging goes all the way back to the
invention of the popular ballot itself. Out of a hoard of nearly two hundred
sherds on which the same name was written, archaeologists have identified
the handwriting of only fourteen individuals.7 More striking still is the
identity of the intended victim. It is one of the most famous names in all
Greek history: Themistocles.
Described as ‘a man of heroic features, as well as heroic temperament’,
Themistocles was not above manipulating the system of ostracism to clear
the ground of rivals and reach the highest elected offices of the Athenian
state. His own turn to fall victim would come later. But it was fortunate for
Athens that this was the man who emerged, during the 480s BCE, to
become one of the most far-sighted and effective political and military
leaders that the city would ever have. It was Themistocles who persuaded
the Athenians to settle their long-running differences with Aegina, to build
a new fortified port at Piraeus (where several natural harbours were more

defensible than the wide beach at Phaleron), and to raise a fleet of armed
warships to match. All this happened between 483 and 481 BCE.8
By this time, Darius had died and had been succeeded as Great King by
one of his sons, Xerxes. In 483 BCE, Xerxes turned his attention to his
father’s unfinished business in the west. This time, nothing was to be left to
chance. The new invasion would be an amphibious operation. To prepare
the way for the foot soldiers, a bridge was formed across the strait of the
Dardanelles by lashing together hundreds of boats to link Asia to Europe.
To ensure a safe passage for the ships in the notoriously stormy waters of
the northern Aegean, a canal was dug through the isthmus that separates the
promontory of Mount Athos from the mainland. The total strength of the
expedition was reckoned by the Greeks at three million men under arms.
Modern scholars dismiss these numbers as fantasy, as they also do
Herodotus’s implausibly exact figure of 2,641,610. But the number of
warships, given as just over one thousand two hundred, has some
corroboration and is enough to give a sense of war being mounted on a
scale never before seen in the small world of the Greek city-states.9
As Darius had done before him, Xerxes sent emissaries ahead of the
expedition. Cities and regions that voluntarily accepted Persian rule would
not be molested. This time, too, most complied. But those that were
determined to resist began to work on a concerted plan of action. A
defensive league was formed, under the leadership of Sparta. Envoys were
even sent to the distant Greek cities of Sicily and south Italy. But as luck
would have it, this was just the time when that other predator, Carthage,
was flexing its muscles in the western Mediterranean. In 480 BCE, decisive
battles would be fought in Sicily, too, against the Carthaginians. So there
was no help to be had from that quarter.10
In the end, only thirty-one city-states, out of several hundred that existed
on the western side of the Aegean, formed the alliance that prepared to
stand against Xerxes. Of these, no more than three were of significant size
or strength: Sparta, Athens, and Corinth; Thebes would notoriously join the
other side when it came to the final battle. Of the remainder, seven were
based on small islands in the Aegean. The rest were about evenly split
between small communities (some of them tiny) in the northern
Peloponnese and the southern part of the Greek mainland, with a few

outliers on the coasts of Macedonia and Epiros farther north.11 Once it was
known that the Persians were on their way, tension arose among the allies.
Should the main line of defence be drawn at the Isthmus of Corinth, as the
Spartans proposed? The Spartans had always been half-hearted about
extending their influence north of the isthmus. And Spartan strategy was
always based on land warfare. This was what their highly trained, full-time
army of hoplites did best. It took an Athenian to point out that there was no
point in fortifying the isthmus if the Persian fleet was left intact to sail
round and take the infantrymen from the rear. And so it was agreed. A stand
would be made farther north.
A first attempt to hold the coastal pass leading from Macedonia
southward into Thessaly was abandoned—which was just as well, because
Xerxes led his troops by an inland route instead. From Thessaly, the only
way for an army to enter southern Greece was through the narrow pass
known as Thermopylae, where the crags of Mount Oeta fell almost sheer to
the sea, opposite the tip of Euboea. The name means ‘hot gates’, referring
to a fortified position which contained thermal springs. Today, the sea has
receded several miles, so it requires an effort of imagination for the visitor
to grasp its strategic importance at the time. But back in 480 BCE,
according to Herodotus, the passage between the mountainside and the sea
was the equivalent of fifty feet wide, narrowing at some points to only the
width of a cart track.12
The Spartans and their land-based allies dug in at one end of the pass,
while a fleet led by the Athenians gathered a few miles to seaward. Neither
the weight of Xerxes’s infantry nor his cavalry could make any headway
against the Spartan hoplites until a local Greek came forward and offered to
show his men a way across the mountain to take the defenders from the
rear. After this betrayal, the greater part of the army still had time to make
its escape to the south. But Leonidas, the Spartan king, elected to stay,
along with the remnant of his three hundred best fighters and a small
contingent from Boeotia, to cover the retreat of the rest and fight to the end.
The battle of Thermopylae, fought in August 480 BCE, has ever afterwards
been remembered for the heroic self-sacrifice of Leonidas and the ‘Three
Hundred’. At the time, for Sparta and the few allied Greek states still
resisting the Persian advance, it was a catastrophic defeat, because it left the

route open to Athens, the Isthmus of Corinth, and beyond it, the
Peloponnese.
During the days of the battle in the pass, several engagements took place
at sea. These were indecisive. The invaders lost more ships to a sudden
storm off the coast of Euboea than to action by the newly tested Athenian
navy. As autumn drew on, Xerxes’s forces began to converge, by land and
sea, on Attica. In the face of this advance, the Athenians abandoned their
city. Only a few diehards held out, sheltering in the sanctuary of the
Acropolis. But then some enterprising Persians scaled the cliffs, opened the
gates to the main force, ‘and slaughtered those in the sanctuary’. Herodotus
goes on, ‘Having left not one of them alive, they stripped the temple of its
treasures and burnt everything on the Acropolis.’13 Many of the damaged
sculptures, belonging to the old temple of the goddess Athena that was
destroyed by the Persians on that occasion, and later buried in the rubble,
can today be seen in the Acropolis Museum in Athens.
The Athenians had lost their city. In the eyes of their Peloponnesian allies,
that meant also their right to command the allied fleet. It was time to fall
back on the Isthmus of Corinth and defend the Peloponnese. But the
Athenians still had two hundred warships at sea. Themistocles threatened to
put the remnants of his people aboard and sail away with them to Italy.
How, then, would the Peloponnese be defended? And so the decision was
taken to engage the enemy at once, in a sea battle. Themistocles tricked the
Persian commanders into thinking their huge fleet could trap the ships of
the Greek allies in the narrow channel that separates the island of Salamis
from the mainland of Attica. In the event, it was the invaders who became
trapped, as the Greek captains were able to exploit the limited sea room to
their advantage. The more unwieldy Persian galleys ended up ramming
each other, while the Greek allies kept discipline. The battle lasted all day,
with King Xerxes watching from the shore. When it was over, the remains
of the Persian fleet limped back to its base at Phaleron.14
Salamis was the turning point. But it was not yet the end of the war.
Xerxes himself returned to Persia, leaving his second in command,
Mardonius, to last out the winter in Boeotia and try to put new momentum
into the campaign come the spring. Before Mardonius left Attica, he sacked
and burnt for a second time whatever had been left standing in Athens. The

final battle was fought in September 479 BCE, near the Boeotian town of
Plataea. Herodotus lists more than a dozen small Greek city-states whose
troops fought alongside the Spartans and Athenians at Plataea. It was a long
and closely fought battle. Mardonius was killed. The Persian retreat turned
into a rout. On the same day, if Herodotus is to be believed, on the other
side of the Aegean a Greek fleet under the surviving Spartan king,
Leotychidas, went into battle against the Persians, who had been guarding
their rear. At Mycale, near the island of Samos, the Greek forces won that
battle, too.15
The ‘Persian Wars’, as the two campaigns of 490 BCE and 480–479 BCE
have been known ever since, were over. Another thirty years would pass
before the threat of a third would finally lift. But by the autumn of 479
BCE, the Greek-speaking world had been transformed out of all
recognition. And although none of those who had fought could have had
any inkling of this, the repercussions of what they had done would still be
reverberating around the entire world two and a half thousand years later.
The Persian Wars have often, since, become a fixed point of reference and
comparison. During the Middle Ages, when the Byzantine capital,
Constantinople, was repeatedly threatened by Muslims from the east, and
even after it had finally fallen to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, historians
writing in Greek would regularly describe the enemy not as ‘Arabs’ or
‘Turks’ but as ‘Persians’. Even though they were fighting for very different
things, it would be self-evident to every Byzantine Christian that the
struggles of their empire against the forces of Islam were a continuation of
the struggles of Athens and Sparta in the fifth century BCE.
In modern times, those ancient battles have been invested with a
significance that goes far beyond the limits of the Greek-speaking world. In
hindsight, the Persian Wars have come to be seen as the first great conflict
between a ‘civilised’ west and a ‘barbarous’ east.16 The British philosopher
and imperial civil servant John Stuart Mill, reviewing an influential history
of ancient Greek civilisation, wrote in 1846:
The true ancestors of the European nations are not those from whose
blood they are sprung, but those from whom they derive the richest

portion of their inheritance. The battle of Marathon even as an event in
English history is more important than the battle of Hastings.17
It is often said that after the last of Mardonius’s troops fled across the
Aegean in their ships, or trudged across the bridge of boats that Xerxes had
built to span the Dardanelles, the Persians would never again return to
threaten the West. But this is a remarkably narrow understanding of the
geopolitical history of the European continent. The truth is that Europe has
been successfully invaded from the east many times since the Persian Wars
—just not, as it happens, by direct descendants of the ancient Medes and
Persians. It is not true, then, that the future history of Europe was secured
by the Greeks at Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea in the first decades of the
fifth century BCE. There must be something else.
The answer lies not in anything that was done on the battlefield but in the
way the story came to be told afterwards. It was Greeks who told the story.
Why else should these wars still, after so long, be called Persian? It was
once again the invention of the alphabet that enabled the Greeks to tell the
story in the way that they did and for it to be preserved ever after. For
centuries before this time, victorious rulers had been proclaiming their
achievements in writing—in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, Assyria, indeed
in Persia. But the Greek world was different. This was in part because of the
new writing system itself, in part because of the peculiar organisation of the
Greek city-states. There was no supreme ruler to decree how victory should
be commemorated, just as there was no top-down system to control the
process. Nobody had a monopoly over the written word. Of all those
Greeks who wrote down what they knew and what they thought about the
Persian Wars, while the events were still within living memory, two were
lucky enough to have their words spread and endure—to the extent that we
can still read what they wrote today.
First into action was an Athenian by the name of Aeschylus. Aeschylus,
as his epitaph tells us, had fought in the citizen army that defeated Darius’s
forces at Marathon. He had probably been an eyewitness of the battle of
Salamis as well, although, aged about forty-five by that time, he may have
been too old for combat. In 472 BCE, just eight years after the battle,
Aeschylus’s play The Persians was put on as part of the annual festival held
in Athens in honour of the god Dionysus. What we still call ‘drama’ was

nothing new in the Greek world at this time. From obscure beginnings
during the previous century, the acting out of well-known stories in front of
the assembled citizens had become an established part of religious rituals in
several city-states, and nowhere more so than in Athens. Aeschylus wrote
altogether about seventy plays. Only seven of these survive today. But the
earliest of these to be written, making it the oldest Greek drama still in
existence, was The Persians.
Aeschylus sets his drama at Susa, the Persian capital. The elders of the
royal court are expecting any day to hear of victories over the Greeks.
Instead, a messenger brings news of the disaster at Salamis. The ghost of
the dead Darius lends dramatic effect. Then Xerxes himself arrives,
humbled and in rags, to general lamentation (following the convention of
the time, the play is after all presented as a ‘tragedy’). The Persians not
only preserves what is thought to be a firsthand account of the battle of
Salamis. It also brings into being an entire moral and geopolitical universe
that had not existed until the Greeks began to take stock, during the decade
that followed the victories of 480 and 479 BCE.
The play presents Xerxes’s overweening pride as an affront to nature and
the gods. His punishment at the hands of the Greeks not only was deserved
but also affirmed what was probably already a traditional Greek way of
thinking about man’s place in the world: pride goes before a fall.18 But this
is not all. Athens is presented in the play as the gateway to Hellas: if Xerxes
had not been defeated by the Athenians, all Hellas would have been his.
The Athenians of course come out of it well, in Aeschylus’s rendering. But
what his play celebrates, for the first time, is Hellas as a land and Hellenes
as a distinct people. There is even a bond between the two: the ‘land of the
Hellenes’ itself fights alongside its people, the chorus of noble Persians is
informed. How can this be, they demand to know? ‘It slays by hunger all
those who are too numerous for it’ comes the terse response, thereby
articulating a permanent demographic reality as well as making powerful
propaganda.19
And those Hellenes, small in number though they were by comparison
with the might of Persia, are presented as fighting for something that, again,
had probably never been articulated before but that would resonate down
the centuries ever afterwards: their liberty. The Persians ask, baffled, How

can such small forces stand up to them? What drives their soldiers into
battle if they are free to speak their own minds and act on their own
initiative? Why wouldn’t they just run away? The answer comes in the
‘great cry’ that supposedly went up from the Greek ships at Salamis:
Sons of Hellenes, onward,
set free your fatherland, set free
your children, wives, the homes of your ancestral gods,
and your forefathers’ graves. For all of these the fight is on!20
By 472 BCE, the Greeks had acquired a cause that was not just the cause
of any one city or region. Retrospectively, it was a cause fit to die for. And
an audience of Athenian theatre-goers, people whose ancestors had always
been accustomed to put their own city first, was ready to hear that, this
time, they had been fighting for something larger. Now they knew that they
were not Athenians only but also Hellenes—unified by a shared identity
and this common ideal: freedom. And because the play was popular at the
time and was still being talked about and revived in Athens some seventy
years later, we can be sure that the new way for Athenians to think about
themselves had caught on.21
Aeschylus was the first. But a play is not history. What really set the seal
on the way the Persian Wars would ever afterwards be remembered was
another of those Greek inventions: the invention of history. To make this
one possible, the new system of alphabetic writing had to make another leap
forward and away from the traditional art of oral storytelling. This was the
leap from verse into prose. A narrative written in prose would still, for
several centuries after this, be more often read aloud to an audience than
read on the page. But the divorce from the traditional techniques for
remembering and delivering a story before an audience meant that any
amount of information could be stored in a document that, for the first time,
need not be memorised but could be retrieved whenever necessary.
This is where Herodotus of Halicarnassus comes into his own. He was not
the first Greek writer to try his hand at prose. But he is the first whose work
has come down to us complete. And so far as we can tell, it was his idea to
use what was still quite an experimental medium, prose, for a new purpose.
Herodotus was born within a few years of the battle of Salamis, perhaps in

484 BCE. Halicarnassus, today the fishing village and tourist resort of
Bodrum in southwestern Turkey, was at the time part of the Persian Empire,
so Herodotus began life as a subject of King Xerxes. If we are to believe his
own account, he travelled widely, taking in most parts of the known world
of his time. Later, he may have settled in Athens. Sometime around 450
BCE, he embarked on what he called the ‘demonstration of an enquiry’.
The task would occupy him for the rest of his life. The subject of this
enquiry was to be ‘what people had done’ in the recent wars, its purpose to
commemorate for all time the actions of both sides, along with the causes of
the conflict.22 The Greek word meaning ‘enquiry’ in Herodotus’s Ionic
dialect of Greek at the time was historie.
Herodotus’s prose narrative is every bit as monumental in size and
ambitious in scope as the Homeric poems. There are plenty of indications
that the inventor of the new genre was looking over his shoulder at the
venerated epics of the Trojan War and its aftermath. But unlike the elusive
Homer, Herodotus the enquirer is a frequent presence in his own narrative
—probing, prodding, weighing up one implausible explanation against
another, and often genially withholding judgement, leaving it to the rational
reader, or hearer, to decide. And for most of what he says, we have nobody
else’s word to compare with his. Historians working today on other parts of
the ancient Mediterranean world often express frustration that they have
only Herodotus, writing in Greek, from the Greek point of view, to rely
on.23
Right from the beginning, Herodotus prepares us for a war between
continents: Europe and Asia. On one side of the Hellespont and the Aegean
Sea stand the Greeks; on the other, the Persian Empire. The idea of Europe
as the seat of a civilisation that we now call ‘European’, and opposed to the
‘barbarism’ of Asia, has its origin in the pages of Herodotus. The Greek
word barbaros at first just meant a foreigner who spoke a different
language. It barely appears before the time of the Persian Wars. Afterwards,
it was on everyone’s lips, and of none more often than of Herodotus. The
people of Asia (other than the Greeks who had settled all round its seaward
edge) were barbaroi. This is the first time that the name ‘Europe’ acquires a
geopolitical meaning. Indeed, in these pages, we can see the modern
geopolitics of ‘East’ and ‘West’ being born. Throughout the nine books that

follow, the clash between the ‘barbarians’ of Asia and the ‘Hellenes’ of
Europe is played out.24
Herodotus rarely misses an opportunity to urge upon his hearers a sense of
unity as Greeks in the face of a common enemy. But the details of his
narrative constantly show up the opposite. With what must surely be
deliberate irony, he puts into the mouth of the Persian general Mardonius
this rueful piece of self-knowledge about his own people:
The Greeks are pugnacious enough, and start fights on the spur of the
moment without sense or judgement to justify them.… Now surely, as
they all talk the same language, they ought to be able to find a better
way of settling their differences: by negotiation, for instance, or an
interchange of views—indeed by anything rather than fighting.25
Not only were the Greek city-states notoriously at one another’s throats,
Herodotus knew perfectly well that the great majority of them had
submitted to the Persians without a fight. This would have been common
knowledge at the time when he was writing, and he makes no attempt to
play it down. He acknowledges, too, that many of the ships and their crews
that fought on the Persian side had been conscripted from Greek cities such
as his own, in Anatolia. Themistocles, Herodotus tells us, had entertained
hopes of persuading these Ionian Greek conscripts to turn against their
masters, or at least to fight only half-heartedly. But he records no mass
desertions. Of the mainland states, he tells us that Thebes actually sent
troops to fight alongside the invaders at the battle of Plataea. Argos, the
only surviving rival to Sparta in the Peloponnese, had maintained an
ambiguous neutrality throughout but helpfully alerted Mardonius when
Spartan troops were on their way to confront him in the same battle.
Herodotus no doubt intended his narrative as an object lesson—on what
Greeks could achieve when they settled their differences and acted together.
But thanks to his candour, we know that in reality the resistance of ‘Hellas’
to the ‘barbarians’ had been a very patchwork affair, nothing like a united
front.26
All the more impressive, then, the way Herodotus tells it, was the
determination and the success against the odds of those who did resist. In
yet another of the dramatic dialogues that enliven his history, the historian

for the first time fleshes out the new understanding of what it meant to be
Greek. While the alliance is forming that will confront the Persians at the
final battle in 479 BCE, Mardonius sends an embassy to the displaced
Athenians. They can have their city back, he tells them, on condition that
they submit to Xerxes. As told by Herodotus, it is a collective Athenian
voice that rousingly rebuffs this offer. For good measure, the Athenians go
on to explain for the benefit of their Spartan allies the reason for their
solidarity at a time when self-interest might have tempted them to abandon
the struggle. First of all, they say, they must avenge the destruction of their
city and its temples. ‘Politics’ (the affairs of the city-state) still come first.
But, secondly, the Athenians go on:
there is the totality of the Greeks, made up of one blood and one
language, and the sanctuaries of the gods which are shared, and
sacrifices and practices carried out in the same way. All of these we
Athenians would never betray.
The single Greek word Hellenikon which I have translated as ‘totality of
the Greeks’ is often rendered in modern translations as ‘Greek nation’.
There has been much discussion of this passage as an early statement of
what today we could call ‘ethnic’ or ‘national’ identity. All the more reason
to look carefully at what Herodotus actually says. Elsewhere in his story, he
uses the same word in contexts where it clearly refers to the Greeks, or the
Greek city-states, all together.27 It is not an abstract word, like nation, race,
or the still more conceptual Greekness or Hellenicity of a later age. Here, it
must mean very specifically all those people who share the things that are
now spelled out by the Athenians in this imagined speech: genetic
inheritance and language most immediately, and then, connected more
loosely by Herodotus’s syntax in Greek, what we would now term ‘culture’.
By the time Herodotus wrote those words, probably in the late 430s BCE,
the ‘totality of the Greeks’, in whose name the victory over Persia had been
secured, was about to tear itself apart in a second great conflict, the
repercussions of which are also still with us to this day. In truth, what
Herodotus called the Hellenikon had never stood together, not even against
the Persians. But the narrative of a common stand against invasion and the
threat of tyranny, by an underdog fighting with great tenacity and at the cost

of great sacrifice, was one that would go on to inspire many others in
centuries to come—whether or not they thought of themselves as sharing
the same ‘blood’, language, or culture as the Greeks of the fifth century
BCE.
The period of almost fifty years that begins after the battle of Plataea in 479
BCE is generally reckoned to mark the high point of the civilisation that we
now call ‘classical Greece’. History books often give the impression that
this, too, came about as a direct result of the Persian Wars. If it hadn’t been
for that cataclysmic upheaval, it’s a reasonable guess that none of it would
have happened in quite the way that it did. On the other hand, much of what
was radically new in the Greek world after 479 BCE can be traced back to
developments that had already been under way before the first Persian
expedition set out. And the new achievements would spread out far and
wide across the whole of that world. Whatever was going on, it was not
limited to the thirty-one or so states that had actively resisted the invaders.
So we might do better to think of the Persian Wars as a catalyst, rather than
as a cause, of what came afterwards.
Between about 520 and the 440s BCE, lyric poets were bringing together
words, music, dance, and ceremony to celebrate public occasions with ever
more dazzling complexity. The career of Pindar, from Thebes, began in the
decade before the battle of Marathon and continued for almost half a
century afterwards. Pindar’s ‘odes’ have been imitated by poets writing in
many different languages, from that time to this. An ode, originally, was
any kind of song. As it happens, the ‘songs’ of Pindar that have been
preserved through the manuscript tradition are those that celebrated victors
in the four ‘panhellenic’ contests, of which the most famous were the
Olympic Games. The words, of course, are all that have been preserved, so
we can only guess at the total multimedia experience that must have been
involved.
Plays and performances, too, an artform that would later be especially
associated with Athens, went back well before the Persian Wars. But almost
all that we know about Greek drama dates from the decades that followed.
Aeschylus continued to write plays for the best part of twenty years after
the success of The Persians. He was followed by the tragedians Sophocles

and Euripides, and the comic dramatist Aristophanes, among dozens of
others whose works survive only in fragmentary form. Several complete
plays by all four have remained in circulation ever since their lifetimes and
have been frequently revived in theatres since the nineteenth century.
Tragedy, the genre that had been co-opted by Aeschylus to capture the
new euphoria after the battle of Salamis, was more usually devoted to
subjects drawn from mythology. But very often, Athenian dramatists would
give a topical twist to their reenactment of a well-known story. According
to Aristotle, writing a century after the heyday of ‘classical’ drama, the
nature of tragedy was ‘by means of pity and fear to bring about the purging
of such emotions’.28 Comedy was more overtly topical. On the comic stage
it was a regular occurrence for prominent citizens and political issues to be
caricatured, often with a hefty dose of obscenity as well as bravura. Among
extravagant whimsies brought onto the Athenian stage, one that is still with
us today is Cloud-Cuckooland (Nephelokokkygia)—still invoked, as it was
then, to mean a never-never land of politicians’ promises.
The main festival at which plays were staged in Athens was known as the
Great Dionysia, held in spring each year. Somewhere between fifteen and
twenty thousand spectators packed into the sanctuary of Dionysus on the
slope below the walls of the Acropolis for several days on end to watch new
plays performed one after the other, from dawn until dusk. The marble-lined
Theatre of Dionysus, that occupies the space today, would not be built until
the next century. Actors wore masks—so that even those in the audience
close enough to have been able to make out facial expressions would have
had to rely, instead, on observing the actors’ gestures and, above all, on
listening to every nuance of the words they spoke.
Action (the literal meaning of the Greek word drama) consisted only of
dialogue or, on occasion, a monologue addressed to the audience. Almost
everything that happens in a Greek tragedy or comedy happens offstage and
is conveyed to the characters, as well as to the audience, by a lengthy
report. A frequent exception to this rule was the appearance of a god or
goddess, lowered from a gantry onto the stage, to wrap things up at the end.
This type of intervention is still known by the Latin phrase deus ex
machina, which translates the Greek for ‘god from the machine’.

All parts were played by men, even though many of the most important
dramatic roles were female. These ranged from goddesses and powerful
figures of legend, such as Helen of Troy or the ‘barbarian’ enchantress
Medea, to the fictional Lysistrata, who leads the Athenian women in a sex
strike in order to force their menfolk to make peace, not war, in the comedy
by Aristophanes named after her (performed in 411 BCE). A large part in
both tragedy and comedy was played by the ‘chorus’ (the word actually
means ‘dance’), a group of actors who would sing and dance in a circular
space, called the ‘orchestra’, in front of the stage. No less than the
ceremonial odes of Pindar, Greek drama was a multimedia, multisensory
experience, only one part of which we can even begin to recapture. Like so
much else in the classical Greek world, writing plays was an intensely
competitive business. Prizes were awarded by judges chosen by lot, so in
effect the dramatists were competing for the approval of a public made up
of their fellow citizens.
The Greek world after 479 BCE looked different, too. In the sanctuary at
Olympia, a new temple, dedicated to Zeus, was built between 471 and 456
BCE. On the pediments, bodies carved from stone convey a sense of
movement. The western pediment, now exhibited in the state-of-the-art new
museum at Olympia, shows a scene from mythology. Brutish Greek
tribesmen called Lapiths battle with centaurs (half-man, half-horse) to
disrupt a wedding feast. In the centre a young god, probably Apollo, naked
except for a cloak held over one shoulder and the opposite arm, with an
expression of serene determination stretches out the other arm to quell the
tumult. The message, if there is one, may not be quite as simple as Greek
sweet reason overcoming subhuman barbarism. But it is there for the
beholder, who might well have wished to see it that way when the temple
was newly built. Some of the figures in this scene and elsewhere among the
surviving sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia have been admired
especially for their nuances of individual expression, including tension,
fatigue, and pain.29
Life-size or slightly larger replica human beings were on the move in the
fifth-century BCE Greek world in another sense, too. At the same time as
sculptors were learning how to represent bodies in motion, the statues they
made began to descend from the pediments of temples and to move out of

cemeteries and sacred spaces into the everyday world of the city. Beginning
in the fifth century BCE, and indeed continuing into the early Middle Ages,
Greek civic spaces would become crowded with look-alike people made of
stone and, increasingly, of bronze.30 Because bronze has always been a
valuable commodity, it is rare for a bronze statue to survive from the
ancient world. Those that do most often come from ancient shipwrecks or
were buried in antiquity, to be dug up by archaeologists in chance finds.
Our best clue to how these human-like figures would have looked in
Greek cities in the years immediately after the Persian Wars comes from
two stunning bronzes salvaged from the sea off the Italian town of Riace in
Calabria in 1972. Slightly larger than life-size, they represent naked
warriors with thick, curly hair and beards. Different materials and an inlay
of semiprecious stones still give a shocking vividness to their staring eyes
and preserve a strong colour contrast in lips, teeth, and nipples. Originally,
the figures would have carried weapons, but these have not survived. The
pair may well have formed part of a group, possibly even designed as a
victory memorial for the Persian Wars, although of course there is no direct
evidence for this. The two bronze men share a similar pose. But this is very
different from the stiff full-frontal pose of the kouroi of the previous
century. Unlike earlier statues and in common with most later ones, these
warriors do not look directly at the viewer. They may not be true portraits,
but they are individual human beings, each absorbed in his own world, a
world that unsettlingly peeps into ours.31
Sculptors by this time had acquired the technical means and had
developed enough understanding of human anatomy to create the likeness
of real individuals. But this would turn out to be a ‘road not taken’. How
and why this came about has been revealed by the painstaking study of that
most domesticated of the visual arts, the paintings produced on high-quality
tableware destined for use within the home. Paradoxical though it may
seem, just as sculptors were learning to capture bodies in motion, their
peers working in two dimensions were cultivating, instead, stillness and
composure in the human figures that they represented. By 450 BCE, a
marked change had come about both in the style and the subjects chosen to
decorate fine bowls, plates, and cups.

Instead of vivid scenes of battle, painters depict the young warrior,
identifiable by his shield, saying farewell to his grieving wife and parents.
Sexually explicit images disappear almost completely. Athletes exercising
or competing naked in the gymnasium are caught in moments of stillness, to
be admired for their beauty and composure, rather than actively competing
as before.32 Often described as idealist, rather than realist or naturalist, this
was the perfect art for the citizen-state of the classical period. In this way,
the aloof serenity of Apollo quelling the riot on the pediment of the Temple
of Zeus at Olympia enters the home of every Greek—and also of the many
customers of Athenian potters among the Etruscans of Italy, where so much
of this intimate tableware would be unearthed by modern archaeologists.33
All these new trends would come together spectacularly when the
Athenians began to rebuild their citadel, the Acropolis. They had waited
more than thirty years since the Persian destruction. Then, starting in 447
BCE, no expense was to be spared. A massive complex of buildings called
the Propylaea was designed as a ceremonial entrance to the sacred space. It
cannot be an accident that the colonnade lining the entryway exactly frames
the view of the distant site where the battle of Salamis had been won back
in 480 BCE. The rebuilt Acropolis was to be the permanent memorial to
that victory.34 Inside, new temples arose, built out of marble quarried from
nearby Mount Pentelikon. First to be completed, and largest of all, was the
temple dedicated to the city’s patron goddess, Athena the Virgin
(Parthenos). The Parthenon, as it has been known ever since, was finished
in just fifteen years. Now an empty shell, after its heart was blown out by a
Venetian cannonball in 1687, its columns and pediments still dominate the
skyline of central Athens. Usually framed against a sky of brilliant blue,
with the humped back of Mount Hymettus in the background, the image of
the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens must be the most widely
recognised ‘trademark’ of Greece and Greek civilisation—just as it was in
the century when it was built. And, of course, it was built to impress.35
As at Olympia, the pediments at either end of the building were decorated
with sculptures. Less usual, and even more famous today, is the frieze in
sculpted marble relief that ran round the top of the inner wall of the
building, beneath the roof, some sixty feet above a viewer standing on the
ground. Originally 160 metres long, the largest surviving portions of this

frieze are exhibited in the British Museum in London and in the Acropolis
Museum in Athens, which opened in 2009. It depicts a procession on foot,
on horseback, and in chariots and culminates in an offering made in the
presence of Athena, Zeus, and other gods and goddesses of Olympus, who
are seated on simple thrones.
Opinions still differ as to what exactly is represented. But whatever its
meaning in detail, there is no mistaking the solemn, collaborative sense of
purpose of the celebrants (despite the liveliness of the horses) and the
subordinate place of several hundred human figures as they approach, with
deference and awe, their own larger-scale likenesses, the Olympians. For all
the admiration that their ‘classical’ white marble has aroused in modern
times, we should not forget that these sculptures, and probably large parts of
the building that housed them, too, would originally have been painted in
bright colours. And until they were taken down and placed in a museum, at
eye level with most viewers, no one could have appreciated their finer
points but the gods.
During the same decades, while on the Acropolis the Parthenon and other
public buildings were rising, down at street level the philosopher Socrates
would engage his fellow citizens in dialogues about the nature and purpose
of human life. Socrates had been born in Athens in 469 BCE. His career
would span the entire second half of the century. What we now call ‘moral
philosophy’ begins with these dialogues, as they would later be
reconstructed, often in highly fictionalised form, by his disciples Plato and
Xenophon. In these seemingly artless conversations, the questioning of the
cosmos that had begun more than a century earlier in Anatolia comes down
to earth. For Socrates, the goal of all human beings was arete. Usually
translated as ‘goodness’ or ‘virtue’, the Greek word has a sharper edge than
these equivalents which derive from the Christian tradition. Arete also has
the meaning of ‘excellence’. It implies an element of competition, that was
entirely characteristic of the Greek city-states of Socrates’s time. In one of
the few passages in which we probably do hear his words unalloyed,
Socrates is reported as saying that it is ‘the greatest good to man’ to ‘engage
in discourse about arete’. The alternative—an ‘unexamined life’—Socrates
goes on, is ‘not livable for a human being’.36

One of those who engaged with Socrates was Protagoras of Abdera, one
of many itinerant philosophers, called ‘sophists’, who visited Athens during
this time. Protagoras is credited with the doctrine that ‘man is the measure
of all things’. If we all live in a cosmos that is regulated by ‘measures’, as
Heraclitus had believed, then it must follow that we ourselves are part of
that universal ‘order’ or ‘arrangement’. Similar thought processes were
leading at the same time in a different part of the Greek-speaking world to
the first systematic examination of the human body, what makes it work,
and how its processes can be put right when we fall ill. On the island of
Kos, in the eastern Aegean, the ‘father of medicine’, Hippocrates, was a
contemporary of Socrates. He, too, is known to us only indirectly through
the works of others. As a result, we cannot be sure which of the medical
discoveries recorded against his name were really his.37 But we know that
the Greek world of the late fifth century BCE was becoming more than ever
centred on the human. Among the pithy moral maxims that were probably
first inscribed on a column in the Temple of Apollo at Delphi at about this
time, the most famous of all must surely be Gnothi seauton: know your own
self.
Ever since the end of the wars against Persia, the lifting of the external
threat had not necessarily brought peace. Until the middle of the fifth
century BCE, Greek forces continued to confront the Persian enemy, in
Anatolia during the 460s BCE and in Egypt (less successfully) in the next
decade. Sparta had withdrawn from the joint expedition to Anatolia after
only a year, back in 478 BCE. From that time on, it had been left to the
Athenians to organise an alliance of the liberated Greek cities to keep up the
pressure against Persia.
Willing allies at the start, these states soon found themselves committed to
doing the bidding of the Athenians, as well as contributing ships and,
increasingly, money to a common treasury. At first, this was housed in the
sanctuary of Apollo at Delos, neutral ground more or less at the
geographical centre of the new alliance. For this reason, the alliance has
become known to modern historians as the ‘Delian League’. Then in 454 or
453 BCE the Athenians unilaterally moved what had become a massive
accumulation of wealth to their own city. One of the reasons for starting

work on building the Parthenon shortly afterwards was to create a secure
home for it. But it was the contributions of the allies that, to a large extent,
paid for the building along with the rest of the programme that over the next
half century would turn the Acropolis and the Agora below into the glorious
statement of self-assertion whose ruins we still admire today. What had
started out as a defensive alliance against a return of the Persians had turned
into Athenian rule over most of the Aegean.
Modern historians regularly use the word empire to describe this
extension of Athenian power during the fifth century BCE. At the time,
there was no equivalent word in Greek, so unprecedented did it seem that
one Greek city-state should lord it over others (even though the Spartans
had already achieved something similar in their immediate sphere of
influence, the Peloponnese). In the earliest account of these events that we
have, the History written by the Athenian Thucydides during the last three
decades of the century, the Athenians are reported as justifying their ‘rule’
over other Greeks in terms that often make modern readers uncomfortable:
We did not establish this rule by force.… We have done nothing
surprising or contrary to human nature in accepting rule over others
when it was offered to us and refusing to give it up, under the
domination of the three most powerful motives—prestige, fear, and selfinterest.… It has always been the way of the world that the weaker is
kept down by the stronger.38
The Athenian empire was based on naval supremacy. This was the direct
legacy of Themistocles’s initiative to invest in the ships that had gone on to
win the battle of Salamis. Sparta, by contrast, concentrated its power on
land. As the century wore on, the Delian League was matched by the
‘Peloponnesian League’, led by Sparta. Of the entire peninsula, only Argos
still held out doggedly against Spartan domination. The two leagues first
clashed in 460 BCE, as each tried to expand its influence over the neutral
territories that lay between them. Athens came off the worse. In 446 BCE,
the Athenians agreed to give up the gains they had made on the mainland in
return for keeping their maritime ‘empire’ intact. The peace agreement
signed in that year was supposed to last for thirty years. It would hold for

only half that long, during which time the rival power blocs eyed one
another warily, each consolidating its grip over the allies it controlled.
In the meantime, during the 460s BCE, Athenian democracy had been
radically overhauled. Exactly how the system had worked before this and,
indeed, many details about these changes remain obscure. But it seems to
have been only at this time that the word demokratia came to be coined and
the fully fledged democracy began to function in the form that we know
from later sources. The entire citizen body of some thirty thousand adult
males was sovereign. In practice, around five to six thousand seem
regularly to have attended the Assembly (Ekklesia), which met
approximately once a month in the open air on the low hill facing the
Acropolis, called the Pnyx. Executive authority was devolved to the Boule,
or Council, of five hundred, chosen by lot each year from the total number
of eligible citizens. Up to fifteen hundred officials, including the members
of the Council, were chosen annually to fulfil all the offices of the state.
Only those in the highest offices, in charge of finance and decisions on the
battlefield, were elected. All the rest were picked at random by the drawing
of lots.
This was very different from a modern democracy, in which the people
elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. In ancient Athens,
the most important decisions were taken by a show of hands in the full
Assembly. Every male citizen had the right to attend. And all officeholders,
whether chosen by lot or elected, were held closely to account. It really was
power (kratos) to the people (demos).39 And the idea of increasing the
wealth and power of their state appealed to the people enormously. The
modern idea that democracies do not fight aggressive wars is certainly not
borne out by the story of Athens in the fifth century BCE. Smaller states
that were either conquered or brought within the Athenian sphere of
influence would often be told to adopt a version of the same system
themselves. The paradox of ‘people power’ being imposed by powerful
outsiders, from above, in situations where it may not be wholly welcome,
goes right back to the first decades when democracy began to spread from
Athens across the Aegean.
It was under this system that Athenian political life, including the building
programme on the Acropolis, came to be dominated by the charismatic

orator Pericles, from the 450s until his death in 429 BCE. So influential was
Pericles that he has often been hailed as the greatest Athenian statesman of
all time, while Athens at its heyday is as often called ‘Periclean’. It says a
great deal for his personality and talents that Pericles managed to exercise
as much influence as he did—since, like every other official, he had to be
elected to office every year. The fact that he was, and over such a long
period, gave continuity to a system that did not inherently value either
experience in office or what we would today call efficiency.40 Thucydides
puts into the mouth of Pericles these often-quoted words in praise of
Athenian democracy, supposedly delivered at the end of the year 431 BCE
on an occasion when the historian had in all probability been present:
We have a system of government that does not take its cues from the
laws of neighboring states; we set the example and do not imitate others.
That system goes by the name of democracy because it is administered
on behalf of the many and not the few. Everyone enjoys equality before
the law on matters of civil disputes. As to personal reputation, whoever
wins esteem for some reason can advance in public affairs—not by turn,
but through merit.41
This democratic Athens, for most of the second half of the fifth century
BCE, was ready, sometimes even eager, to take risks. The Spartans, by
contrast, holding rigidly to a system that had changed little over several
centuries and permanently fearful of the threat from the helots, were by
nature risk averse. Sparta still could field the most formidable citizen army
in the Greek-speaking world. But qualifications for maintaining full
citizenship were so strict, and so demanding, that fewer fighting men were
available whose loyalty could be truly relied on. And when it came to
resources, the Spartans never learned to be as unscrupulous as their
Athenian rivals in extracting what was in effect protection money from the
other members of the Peloponnesian League.42
Despite having led the resistance against the Persians in 480 and 479
BCE, the Spartans seem to have been the least inclined, or perhaps the least
able, of all the Greeks to enjoy the fruits of their victory. No great new
public buildings, no flowering of the arts or crafts, no poetry, history,

philosophy, or scientific enquiry arose in Sparta during the fifth century
BCE. By the 430s, if anything, the two great powers within the small world
of the Greek city-states had come to define themselves by their differences
from one another.
War broke out between them in 431 BCE. The Spartans started it, using a
variety of pretexts. But the real reason, as Thucydides shrewdly noted,
writing not long afterwards, was ‘the growth of Athenian power and
Spartan fear of it… when they could see much of Greece already subject to
Athens’.43 The war lasted much longer than the Persian campaigns—for
twenty-seven years, on and off. Thucydides tells us at the beginning of his
narrative that the conflict would spread to the entire Greek world, and even
beyond—making it, for its time, the equivalent of a world war.44 But what
led to this second Greek war of the fifth century BCE being seen as truly
global is once again not so much what happened on the battlefield but the
way the story came to be told afterwards. The Peloponnesian War, as it is
known today, is one case where history was not written by the victors. The
Athenians lost. But Thucydides’s meticulous, judicious account of causes
and effects, of strategies and decision-making, of human brutality and
human capacity for error has never ceased to be read since shortly after the
war came to an end.45
It started out as a war of attrition. Each summer, Spartan hoplites would
march northwards through the mountain passes of the Peloponnese, cross
the Isthmus of Corinth, and invade Attica. They would stay for up to six
weeks, burning and looting the crops, while the Athenians would be driven
back inside their defensive walls. But, thanks to the initiatives taken by
Themistocles in preparation for the second Persian invasion, the new port at
Piraeus was linked directly to the city by two parallel lines of fortification,
known as the Long Walls. This meant there was nothing the Spartans could
do to prevent their enemies from being supplied by sea. Athens already
relied on grain brought from the hinterland of the Hellespont and the Black
Sea coast. For as long as their fleet ruled the seas, the people of Athens
could still be fed.
It was probably as a consequence of overcrowding inside the city during
the summer heat that plague broke out in 430 BCE. Over four years, as

many as a quarter of the total population may have died from the plague.
The veteran Pericles was among its victims. It was the first pandemic in
recorded history. Thucydides, who himself became infected, treats his
readers to a clinical and harrowing account of its symptoms and its effects
on the population:
The most dreadful aspects of the whole affliction were the despair into
which people fell when they realized they had contracted the disease…
and the cross-infection of those who cared for others: they died like
sheep, and this was the greatest cause of mortality. When people were
afraid to visit one another, the victims died in isolation.… The greatest
pity for the dying and the distressed was shown by those who had had
the disease and recovered. They had experience of what it was like and
were now confident for themselves, as the plague did not attack the
same person twice, or at least not fatally.46
While the Spartans were trying to throttle their enemy on land, the
Athenians did the same by sea. They never came as close to Sparta itself as
the Spartans did to Athens. But they did manage to gain a toehold in the
southwest of the Peloponnese, an especially sensitive spot for the Spartans,
ever alert to the risk that the local helots there might rise against them. By
421 BCE, after ten years of campaigning in theatres all over mainland
Greece and the Aegean, a stalemate was reached. Peace terms were agreed.
It was to prove a phoney peace.
In the years 416 and 415 BCE, Athens had recovered sufficiently to
embark on two of the most notorious episodes of the war—while still
technically observing the armistice and defensive treaty with Sparta. The
first was directed against the island of Melos in the Cyclades. Melos was a
rare case of an Aegean island that had never joined the Athenian alliance
and still remained loyal to Sparta. While the islanders waited in vain for a
Spartan expedition to arrive and relieve them, the Athenians laid siege to
their chief town. Thucydides presents at length the negotiations between the
two sides. The passage in his history has ever since been known as the
‘Melian Dialogue’, and it has much in common with a scene from a tragic
drama. It is here that the historian sets out most fully, and most chillingly,
the foundations of what we now call Realpolitik. Just like a tragic dramatist,

Thucydides himself declines to comment on the views expressed. When the
Melians finally surrendered, without conditions, in January 415 BCE:
Of the Melian population the Athenians executed all the grown men
who came into their hands and enslaved the children and women. Later
they colonized the place themselves, sending out five hundred settlers of
their own.47
Three months later, back in Athens, the tragedy by Euripides, The Trojan
Women, was staged at the Great Dionysia. The play focuses on the plight of
female survivors of a deadly war and the cruelty of the victors. Whether the
Athenian audience saw in this a moral condemnation of their own recent
behaviour we do not know. The fate of Melos was by no means the only
atrocity recorded by Thucydides during a war that increasingly brutalised
all who participated in it. But thanks to the Melian Dialogue, it is the one
that has remained the most remembered, ever afterwards.
The same year, 415 BCE, saw the Athenians overreaching themselves
again. And this time it was they themselves who would pay the price. In
June, an expedition set out from Piraeus that consisted of 134 warships, an
unknown number of troopships carrying more than five thousand hoplites,
with a small contingent of cavalry, and thirty supply ships. It was, says
Thucydides, ‘at that time the costliest and most magnificent Greek armada
ever to sail from a single city’. It would be followed by a second, in
response to a desperate plea for reinforcements, a year later.48 Their
destination was Syracuse, the most powerful Greek city of Sicily. Rather
than attack the Spartan enemy on their own ground, and persuaded by the
charismatic young general Alcibiades, the Athenian Assembly had voted to
broaden the conflict by opening up a new front far to the west. There were,
possibly, wealth and resources to be won that would tip the balance of
power in favour of Athens. By the logic of the warmonger, in all times and
places, Alcibiades had argued that ‘if we do not rule others, others will rule
us’.49
After a two-year campaign it ended in disaster. The entire fleet was lost.
In the last of a series of land battles in Sicily, Athenian hoplites, tormented
by thirst, fought among themselves to gulp down river water that was

running with the blood of their comrades, while the enemy hacked and shot
arrows at them from either bank. Some seven thousand survivors were
taken prisoner and held for months in terrible conditions in stone quarries
on the outskirts of Syracuse that can still be seen by visitors today. Other
survivors of the defeated army fled into the Sicilian countryside and
eventually made their way back to Athens to tell the tale. Two of the
Athenian generals who surrendered were put to death by their captors.
Alcibiades, one of the most colourful characters of his times, had already
deserted the troops he was supposed to be leading, later to give his services
to the kings of Sparta.
Astonishingly, despite the magnitude of their defeat, the Athenians set to
work immediately building a new fleet. But the framework of their
democracy had been weakened by the disaster. In 411, a group of oligarchs
staged a coup d’état. That, too, would prove unstable, and democracy would
be restored the next year. Two events had already happened that would
decisively change the course of the war. In March 413 BCE, while the final
stages of the Athenian collapse in the west were still unfolding, the Spartans
returned to Attica. But this time, instead of merely disrupting the harvest
and stealing the produce, as they had done before, they thought to fortify an
outpost within the territory of Attica itself. Now the Athenians really were
penned up behind their walls, and not just for a few weeks each summer but
throughout the year. And then, the following summer, the Spartans revoked
their long-standing hostility to the common enemy Persia and made a deal
with representatives of the new Great King, Darius II.
So much, one might think, for the much-vaunted superiority of the
Hellene over the barbarian and the collective self-confidence of the Greeks
in the decades after Salamis and Plataea. The reality was that both sides had
been trying to open negotiations with the Persians right from the first years
of the Peloponnesian War. Up to this time, the Persians had kept these
approaches at arm’s length. For as long as the rival Greek city-states were
doing their own dirty work for them, there was no incentive for the Persians
to intervene. But after the collapse of Athenian sea power in the Sicilian
campaign, Darius saw an advantage to be gained from supporting the
Spartans.
According to the text of the treaty signed in 412 BCE, as reported by
Thucydides, Sparta not only pledged itself to fight alongside the Persians

for the defeat of Athens but acknowledged that ‘All the territory and all the
cities which are in the King’s possession, or were in the possession of the
King’s forefathers, shall belong to the King.’ In other words, all those
Greeks living on the eastern side of the Aegean, who had been liberated at
the end of the Persian Wars by the combined efforts of Athens and Sparta,
were now to be returned by Sparta to the Persians. From the beginning, the
Spartans had claimed to be fighting to ‘liberate Hellas’ from the
overweening power of Athens. That claim was looking very threadbare
now.50
At the same time, the Athenians were still trying to woo the old enemy to
their side. Hopes of help from Persia lingered in Athens until 407 BCE. But
in that year, Darius sent his son Cyrus to Anatolia as the new satrap. Cyrus
worked closely with the new naval commander by the name of Lysander
sent out by Sparta. Lysander was evidently an able strategist and, unusually
for Sparta, of relatively humble birth. The Spartan state by this time had
ships of its own. But it was the war fleet of the Persians, manned by
Phoenician sailors and under the command of Cyrus, that gave this new
alliance a commanding position in the Aegean.51
Even so, the Athenians were still putting up a convincing fight at sea. The
battle of Arginusae, fought in 406 BCE in the strait between the island of
Lesbos and the mainland of what is now Turkey, would be described later
by the historian Diodorus of Sicily, writing in Greek, as ‘the greatest naval
battle in history of Greeks against Greeks’.52 It was a resounding triumph
for the Athenians. But victory was soured when a storm prevented the
rescue of survivors from the ships that had been lost in the battle, or proper
burial for the dead. On their return to Athens, six of the eight commanders
were collectively put on trial by the Assembly for this negligence,
condemned to death, and executed. It was not the finest hour of the recently
restored Athenian democracy.
The Spartans and their Persian allies determined to cut off the supply of
grain and other foodstuffs to Athens through the straits leading from the
Black Sea to the Aegean. Another sea battle, fought the following year at
Aegospotami in the Dardanelles, all but wiped out the Athenian fleet. The
news reached Athens at night. The well-to-do Athenian Xenophon, who
was probably in the city at the time, would later capture the moment:

A sound of wailing arose and extended first from Piraeus, then along the
Long Walls until it reached the city. That night no one slept. They
mourned for the lost, but more still for their own fate. They thought that
they themselves would now be dealt with as they had dealt with
others.53
For several months, during the winter of 405–404 BCE, Athens and
Piraeus were besieged by land and sea. In the spring, forced into starvation,
the Assembly voted to accept the terms of peace laid down by Sparta.
Thanks in part to the moderation of Lysander, then in command of Spartan
forces on the ground, the Athenians would not have to share the fate that
they themselves had meted out to the Melians and others. Their lives would
be spared. But they must never again possess a war fleet of more than
twelve ships. All Athenians who had been exiled (prominent among them
being the oligarchs who had seized power in 411 BCE) were to be recalled.
The Long Walls and the defences around Piraeus were to be destroyed. And
Athens was henceforth to obey the will of Sparta in all military matters.
This part of the story is not told by Thucydides. His history breaks off in
411 BCE, although we have his word for it that he had seen the war through
to the end and intended to tell the story in full. Instead, we have to rely on
Xenophon, who is less judicious and far less reliable—and who, by the time
he came to write up these events, had transferred his own loyalty to the
winning Spartan side. It was in this spirit, and probably oblivious to the
bitter irony of his words when set alongside the victorious conclusion of
that other great conflict seventy-five years before, that Xenophon brings
down the curtain on the Greek tragedy that was the Peloponnesian War:
After this, Lysander sailed into Piraeus, the exiles returned, and the
walls were pulled down among scenes of great enthusiasm and to the
music of flute girls. It was thought that this day was the beginning of
liberty for Hellas.54

404 BCE–322 BCE

I

t was a strange sort of liberty. Neither of the Greek rivals had proved

strong enough to beat the other on a level playing field. Everybody knew
that the power of Athens had been broken only thanks to the vastly superior
resources of the old enemy, Persia. After the war was over, interstate
politics in the Greek world continued to be as rancorous as before. There
was one difference, though. After the Spartans made their treaty with the
Persian Great King in 412 BCE, an external ringmaster was always
involved in the affairs of the Greek city-states. For half a century after the
end of the Peloponnesian War, that would be Persia—until another entirely
unexpected player entered the ring.
On the Athenian side, losses in battle and from the plague during the
war’s early years had reduced the citizen body to little more than half of
what it had been during the heyday of the previous century. On top of the
humiliation of having part of their fortifications demolished and
surrendering most of their remaining fleet, the Athenians had to submit to
being ruled by a thirty-man junta, known ever since as the Thirty Tyrants.
In reprisals against democrats, somewhere between twelve hundred and
fifteen hundred Athenians were murdered under their regime.1 Within
months, civil war broke out. The Spartans then changed their policy. After
only a year, democracy was restored—for the second time in a decade.
Slowly, a morally and financially depleted Athens began to rebuild
something of what had been lost.

5. Alexander’s expedition and empire

3307

For Sparta, it was a classic case of ‘winning the war but losing the peace’.
It may have been because the polis system offered no rules on how to
exercise authority over outsiders that Greek city-states, when they did find
themselves in a position to do so, were so bad at it. The Athenians had
failed in the fifth century BCE; now it was to be the turn of the Spartans.
Victory over Athens simply replaced a much-resented Athenian empire with
a Spartan one that would soon be resented, if anything, even more. By the
time the Thirty Tyrants had been deposed in Athens, divisions had already
deepened between the Spartans and the two most powerful states that had
been allied with them in the war against Athens: Corinth and Thebes. The
two-way rivalry of the past century and a half was giving way to a more
complex set of relationships that would involve all four of these city-states
and dozens of minor ones. This was the dynamic that would play out in the
Greek-speaking world over the coming decades.2
Far away to the east, Darius II of Persia died in the same year as the
Peloponnesian War ended, 404 BCE. The new Great King was Artaxerxes
II. But his claim was contested by his brother Cyrus, the satrap in Anatolia
who had proved such a good friend to the Spartans in general and to
Lysander in particular during the final years of the war against Athens. The
Greek cities of Anatolia, as well as Sparta itself, opted to back the man they
knew, Cyrus, for the throne of Persia. A contingent of mercenaries from
other Greek states, known ever afterwards as the ‘Ten Thousand’, joined in.
But then Cyrus was killed in a battle on the banks of the Euphrates in 401
BCE. The story of the mercenary expedition is vividly told by Xenophon,
who had left Athens to join it and ended up commanding the remnant that
made its way through many hardships to the Black Sea coast and thence to
the Aegean.3 The Greeks had picked the wrong side after all. They found
themselves up against the new satraps sent to the region by the victorious
Artaxerxes. Sparta, still backed by the Greek city-states of the region, went
on to fight a limited war against them for several more years.
To put a stop to this, the Persian satrap came up with a psychologically
astute ploy. In 396 or 395 BCE, he sent bribes in gold to ‘the leading men in
various states on the understanding that they would make war on Sparta’. If
Xenophon is to be believed, the Athenians disdained the money. They ‘were
ready enough for the war in any case, as they thought that empire was their

own prerogative’. Another historian tells us that they took the cash anyway.
So did the Thebans and Corinthians, and perhaps others.4
The Corinthian War, as it has become known, lasted until 386 BCE. On
one side were the Spartans; on the other, a fragile alliance of Thebes,
Corinth, Argos, and Athens, backed by Persia. Once the allies began to gain
the advantage, the Persians shifted back to supporting Sparta. As a result,
the Spartans emerged as marginally ahead of their rivals at home. The
commander of their fleet, Antalcidas, who had once again defeated an
Athenian naval force in the Hellespont, went all the way to Susa, the
Persian capital, to negotiate terms of peace with Artaxerxes. So far as these
concerned the Greek states, the terms were designed to benefit Sparta. But
the author and principal beneficiary of the peace treaty was the Great King
himself. For this reason, it would most often be called, then and later, the
‘King’s Peace’.
This time, Sparta really did have to hand back to Persia all the Greek
‘cities of Asia’ that had been liberated at the end of the Persian Wars—a
promise that had been made during the later stages of the Peloponnesian
War, but not fulfilled. In the event of the treaty being violated, the king
reserved to himself the right to intervene with full military force. The
King’s Peace was understood to apply to all Greek states, whether or not
they had formally ratified it. For those that did, including Athens, Sparta,
Corinth, and Thebes, it was not quite an act of submission, such as the gift
of earth and water that had once been demanded by Artaxerxes’s
predecessors. But it did surrender the unambiguous right to regulate
relations among the Greek states. Their much-prized ‘autonomy’, meaning
from each other, was guaranteed at the same time—but at the price of
acknowledging the Great King as final arbiter among them.5
From the Persian point of view, the King’s Peace worked extremely well.
The Greek states continued to war among themselves, often using the
treaty’s terms as a pretext. The Peace would be renewed several times, and
each time followed by new wars. Artaxerxes II, who reigned until 358 BCE,
could be forgiven for thinking that the chronic boil on the western flank of
his empire had finally been lanced.
In 378 BCE there came another shift in the balance of power among the
Greek city-states. In Thebes, newly liberated from direct control by Sparta,

a democratic regime brought to prominence two men who would go on to
dominate politics on the Greek mainland until both were killed during the
wars of the next decade, Pelopidas and Epameinondas. One of the few
really decisive battles of this period was won by the Thebans, led by
Epameinondas, over the Spartans at a place called Leuctra, not far from
Thebes, in 371 BCE. The Thebans under Epameinondas pressed home their
advantage. The Spartan homeland of Laconia had never been invaded by an
enemy since, according to their oldest legends, their own Dorian ancestors
had arrived to displace the native helots. Now, Theban troops advanced
right up to the outskirts of Sparta itself. It seems to have been
Epameinondas who thought of the killer blow. According to the terms of the
King’s Peace, every Greek polis was supposed to be autonomous. What
better pretext could there be, now that Thebes had gained the upper hand,
for joining forces with the enslaved helots of Messenia and compelling the
Spartans to grant them their liberty as an autonomous city-state?
This was what the Spartans had most dreaded for centuries. Now it came
to pass. Epameinondas has ever afterwards been remembered as the
liberator of this oppressed population. His motive was probably less what
we would call today humanitarian, and more a matter of political strategy.
Once the Messenian helots had been liberated, Epameinondas encouraged
them to build their own city. The walls and many of the public buildings of
Messene, founded shortly afterwards, are still impressive today. The
Spartans would never afterwards sign up to any treaty that included
recognition of Messene as a free polis. As a direct result, once-mighty
Sparta would become increasingly marginalised in Greek affairs from this
time on.
But still the Greek city-states continued to wage war among themselves.
Athens began to rebuild a set of maritime alliances that more cautiously
mirrored the Delian League of a hundred years before. This time, though,
the Athenians more often than not sided with their old rivals, the Spartans,
to try to halt the rising power of Thebes. Matters came to a head once again
in a battle fought outside the city of Mantinea, in the centre of the
Peloponnese, not far from today’s Tripoli, in 362 BCE. On one side were
the Thebans, supported by all the Peloponnesian states that had benefited
from Theban intervention against Sparta. On the other were the Spartans,
their few remaining allies from the Peloponnese, and a contingent sent by

Athens. As the now elderly Xenophon put it, writing not long after the
event:
Nearly the whole of Greece had been engaged on one side or the other,
and everyone had imagined that, if a battle was fought, the winner
would become the dominant power and the losers would be their
subjects.
In the event, ‘both sides claimed the victory’, but neither side ‘was any
better off after the battle than before it’.6
Xenophon had already noted, a few pages earlier, writing about the
Athenian contingent at Mantinea, ‘Good men among them were killed and,
very evidently, those whom they killed themselves were good men too.’
The historian left it to others to record that his own son, Gryllos, had been
among the Athenian dead. Epameinondas, too, died shortly afterwards of a
wound he had received during the battle. One account even credits Gryllos
with delivering the fatal blow. A statue of Epameinondas, erected in Thebes
shortly afterwards, bore an inscription that commemorated his
achievements in the Peloponnese. Thanks to him, it claimed, ‘all Hellas’
was now ‘autonomous in freedom’.7 The promise of local autonomy, that
had been enshrined in the terms of the King’s Peace, was now, thanks to
Epameinondas, supposed to apply to the entire Greek world. One wonders
what anybody thought the boast could possibly mean, in the circumstances.
Xenophon was not far off the mark when he concluded, in almost the last
sentence of his history, ‘There was even more uncertainty and confusion in
Greece after the battle than there had been previously.’ One modern
commentator puts it more pithily: the city-states ‘had reached a balance of
impotence’.8 The reality of what Greeks were doing during the first half of
the fourth century BCE is depressing. But to hear them talk, you would
hardly have guessed it.
And we can hear them talking. That, paradoxically, is their real achievement
at this time—to enable us to listen in to what some of them, at any rate,
were thinking and saying. In 399 BCE, the seventy-year-old Socrates had
been prosecuted before an Athenian law court, charged with impiety and

‘corrupting the city’s youth’. This was only four years after the brutal
regime of the Thirty Tyrants had been overthrown and democracy restored.
Several members of that junta, in their time, had been among the ‘youth’
allegedly corrupted by the accused. The charge of ‘impiety’ might well
have resonated with a citizen jury still edgily looking for scapegoats after
their city’s defeat by Sparta.9 Socrates was found guilty and condemned to
die by drinking hemlock in prison. It is one of the best-known stories of
classical antiquity. But its aftermath was to affect even more than the future
course of Western philosophy.
Beginning quite shortly after Socrates’s death, and continuing for half a
century afterwards, two of his pupils determined to perpetuate his legacy.
One of these was Xenophon, the historian, who was also a philosopher. The
other, Plato, had been born in 427 BCE and would go on to lay the
foundations for a whole philosophical tradition, including aspects of
Christianity. Both men presented to a reading public a series of
conversations that supposedly had taken place between Socrates and a host
of interlocutors while he had been alive. Increasingly over time, it is
thought, Plato relied on the dramatic device of the dialogue and the fictional
voice of Socrates to expound ideas which were all his own.
The most ambitious of Plato’s dialogues, known in English as the
Republic, sets out a rather unworldly version of the ideal state. Although he
was not averse to grappling with political issues—indeed, at one stage he
gave advice to a ‘tyrant’ of Syracuse in Sicily—Plato’s philosophy tended
to advocate a withdrawal from the real, visible world altogether. Everything
that we see and experience, Plato argued, is only a crude copy of the eternal
and unchanging ‘idea’ or ‘form’ that it embodies. It is the task of the
philosopher to reach out for knowledge of the real thing, even if it will
always lie beyond our senses. Plato’s idealism is a far cry from the Greekon-Greek carnage of the Corinthian War, or Leuctra, or Mantinea, or the
politicking that fed those conflicts. But thanks to Plato’s artful handling of
the written word, we never lose the impression that we are listening to the
speaking voice of Socrates, in the constant to and fro of conversation.
At the same time, the art of public speaking flourished as never before,
particularly in Athens, where citizens addressed the Assembly or the law
courts. This was the art that in time would come to be known by the Greek

word rhetoric and is still with us today. The English oratory derives from
its Latin equivalent. In the world of a Greek polis, to able to speak well in
public, and to persuade your hearers, was much more than an
accomplishment. In a law court, it could be a matter of life or death; a
speech in the Assembly could make the difference between peace and war.
Just like the informal conversations of Socrates, formal speeches, too,
were beginning to cross over into the domain of writing and gain a new life
far beyond their original context. By the time that Socrates was tried and
condemned, it was becoming increasingly common for orators to compose
their speeches in writing ahead of their delivery—just as politicians or their
speechwriters do today. Not only that, but in Athens a lively market had
grown up for ghostwritten speeches to be used in law courts. In a legal
system in which there were no barristers and every citizen had to plead his
own case before a jury that might be made up of five hundred fellow
citizens, there was a market for ready-made speeches written in advance
and memorised for the occasion. If you lacked the spontaneous brilliance of
a Socrates but could afford the expense, your chances of winning your case
would be greatly enhanced when you hired a professional to write your
speech for you.
No doubt the same thing went on in other cities too. But it was in recently
defeated Athens that the art of speechwriting really caught fire. This was
how Isocrates (no relation to Socrates) started out in his thirties around the
year 400 BCE. But soon Isocrates went one better. On his own admission,
he lacked the physical stamina to stand up before an audience of six
thousand in the Assembly or the five hundred that made up the city’s
Council or a citizen jury in a court of law. Instead, Isocrates created a name
for himself as, in effect, the world’s first political columnist—more than
two thousand years before the first newspapers. Always couched in the
form of a spoken address before a live audience, his speeches were
carefully composed in the study, on a papyrus roll, and then circulated in
manuscript copies, the equivalent of publication in a preprint age. If
Socrates had been the greatest philosopher who never wrote a word, his
near-namesake is remembered as the greatest speechmaker of the ancient
world who never made a speech.10

In 380 BCE, Isocrates published his Panegyricus, or Festival Speech. The
King’s Peace had been handed down six years before. Isocrates makes out
that he is addressing a crowd assembled from all over the Greek world to
celebrate one of the great ‘panhellenic’ festivals, such as the Olympic
Games. Now, he argues, is the time for the Greek city-states to sink their
differences and win new glories in ‘an expedition… gathered together in the
cause of the liberty of our allies, dispatched by all Greece, and faring forth
to wreak vengeance on the barbarians’, that is to say, on the Persians who
had twice invaded their homeland a century before.11 That the Greeks could
unite at all for such a purpose was scarcely credible in 380 BCE. But
Isocrates draws on the imagined setting for his speech to invoke the spirit of
collective euphoria that had been new in the time of Aeschylus and
Herodotus. He urges his fellow Hellenes to go beyond identifying with their
own particular city-state or region and identify, instead, with Hellas as a
whole.12
On the face of it, Isocrates was promoting the same idea of Greek unity as
Herodotus had once done. But there is a difference. The historian from the
Ionian mainland had been even-handed in giving each of the city-states
(more or less) its due. Isocrates writes as an Athenian. His whole argument
is designed to create a leading role in the proposed expedition for his own
city. Athens, he declares, now leads the rest of the Greek world in the art of
fine speaking—indeed, in the very sort of verbal dexterity that is on display
in the Festival Speech:
By so much has our city exceeded all mankind in matters of thought and
speech, that her students have become the teachers of others; she has
caused the name of Greeks to be understood, not in terms of kinship any
more, but of a way of thinking, and people to be called Greeks if they
share our educational system, rather than a common ancestry.13
At a stroke, Isocrates had redefined what it meant to be Greek. No longer
primarily a matter of kinship or biological inheritance, identity is to be
understood as a set of values that anyone can aspire to attain, given
sufficient goodwill and effort. In all probability, long before this, outsiders
had been attracted to Greek ways of doing things and had adopted Greek

customs and even the Greek language. There were signs of something of the
sort having happened as far back as Mycenaean times. But to spell it out
like this, and to propose it in writing as a principle that applied to all
Greeks, now and in the future—that was entirely new. And, against the
grain of political probability or the military realities of the time, it was to
prove a self-fulfilling prophecy. How this would come about, no one alive
in 380 BCE could possibly have foreseen. But both Isocrates and Plato,
with their mastery of the written word masquerading as oral speech, would
play their parts, both in and beyond their lifetimes. More than two thousand
years before there was ever any question of Athens becoming the real
capital of Greece, the city that had been humiliated in the Peloponnesian
War and that still struggled to project its power on the battlefield was on its
way to becoming the world’s first cultural capital.
When Isocrates sent out his Festival Speech to be copied and circulated,
Philip II, King of the Macedonians, as he would come to be known, was
just two years old. Twenty years later, and two years after the Greek citystates had fought themselves to an impasse at Mantinea, the death of his
brother in battle brought Philip to the throne. The year was 360 BCE.14 The
battle had been fought between Macedonians and Illyrians, far away on the
northern fringe of the Greek world. At the time, the news was barely
noticed among the city-states. But this was the event that would herald the
arrival, within a very few years, of a new and decisive force in interstate
Greek politics.
Contemporaries recognised even in his lifetime that ‘Europe had never
produced a man like Philip son of Amyntas’. It was a two-edged
assessment. Tales of Philip’s drunkenness and debauchery abounded in the
ancient world. But at the same time, according to one later account, he had
been ‘possessed of eloquence and a remarkable oratorical talent’. Wounds
sustained in battle at different times in his life had left him with one eye and
a pronounced limp. But much of Philip’s later success would be the result
of astute diplomacy rather than the brutality of which he was also capable.
A modern biographer credits him with creating the ‘first nation state in
Europe’ and suggests that it was Philip, far more than his more famous son

Alexander, who truly laid the foundations for the conquests and the new
Greek civilisation to come.15
This was the man who wasted no time in pulling together the ramshackle
kingdom he had inherited. Next, he began to enlarge it at the expense of its
neighbours. The nearest of these were the settlements that Greeks from the
southern Aegean had been building on the coastline of Macedonia and
Thrace for several centuries. All of these had been established on the polis
model and were technically autonomous. But from the early years of the
Peloponnesian War, Athens and Sparta had competed for the allegiance of
these settlements; each, at different times, exercised varying degrees of
control over them. Now, Philip began a series of campaigns to take control
of his own coastline and gain access to the sea. With a mixture of guile and
brute force, one by one he annexed these settlements to his kingdom or else
obliterated them.
With Macedonia well on the way to becoming a regional power, it was
only to be expected that the next time war broke out among the Greek citystates, Philip would be drawn in. In 355 BCE, a spat began over the
custodianship of the sanctuary of Delphi. A ‘sacred war’, as conflicts of this
type were conventionally known, dragged on for almost ten years. The
immediate protagonists were Thebes and a number of very small states
indeed, in central Greece, that traditionally had worked together to
administer the sacred site. But as usual, the conflict widened through a
network of shifting alliances. It was an appeal to Philip by one of the states
involved, in 353 BCE, that brought the Macedonians for the first time into
the fray. By 346 BCE, when terms of peace were hammered out, Philip was
in a position to dictate them. And despite face-saving formulas all round, it
was he who emerged as the only real victor—the new master of the ring.16
For the Greeks of the most powerful city-states, the immediate challenge
was political and military: How to respond to this new threat to their own
ambitions? But thanks to the Athenian habit of preserving their political
debates in writing, we can see that a deeper perplexity held the southern
Greeks in its grip. The argument was not only about politics. It was also
about identity. Who were those Macedonians who had suddenly arrived on
the doorstep of the Greek city-states and seemed poised to take over? For
Demosthenes, the statesman whose passionate oratory would dominate the

Athenian Assembly from the 350s to the 320s BCE and be admired ever
since, Philip was a monster bent on the destruction of everything the Greeks
had ever held dear. ‘Not only is he no Hellene,’ thundered Demosthenes in
a speech delivered at a time when the peace of 346 BCE was already
beginning to unravel, but also
he has nothing to do with the Hellenes. He is not even a barbarian from
a place that one could speak well of, but a pestilence of a Macedonian,
from a place that used not to be able to provide even a slave worth
buying.17
One Athenian’s idea of a ‘pestilence’ could be another’s golden
opportunity. Isocrates was ninety years old in 346 BCE but as active an
opinion-former as ever. He had never given up on his long-cherished idea of
a united Greek expedition against Persia. Here, in Philip, was a force
capable of filling the gap at the top and providing the leadership that had
eluded both Athens and Sparta for so long. In a wordy and often obsequious
open letter, written in May 346 BCE, Isocrates addresses Philip directly and
lays out for him his destiny. This is to be nothing less than to unite all the
Greeks and lead them in avenging the wrongs inflicted by the Persians a
century and a half before.18
Isocrates was writing as much for home consumption as to flatter the man
he addressed. For the benefit of his Athenian readers, he played up the
traditional claim made by Macedonian monarchs that their dynasty was
directly descended from the demigod of legend, Heracles, and had come
originally from the city of Argos in the Peloponnese. As a descendant of the
most ‘Hellenic’ hero of all time, argued Isocrates, Philip was ideally suited
to lead the expedition against the Persian ‘barbarians’. His subjects, the
Macedonian rank and file, on the other hand, Isocrates rather carefully
describes as ‘a kinship group not of the same race’. Greek speakers would
have to rethink the simple division of the world into ‘Hellenes’ and
‘barbarians’ that went back to the Persian Wars. From now on, and for as
long as it continued to matter, ‘Macedonians’ would become an in-between
category, sometimes opposed to ‘Hellenes’, sometimes grouped along with

them in opposition to ‘barbarians’, depending on the point of view of the
person speaking.19
The question of Macedonian identity, that so preoccupied Athenian
opinion-formers and politicians in the middle of the fourth century BCE,
has continued to divide scholars in our own day. The truth must surely be
that the Macedonians living in the time of Philip II were as ‘Hellenic’ as
they chose to be—and when they chose to be. Often, they seem to have
prided themselves on their differences from the Greeks of the city-states.20
Macedonia was, in Greek terms, an ethnos, meaning a more or less tribal
society ruled by a hereditary monarch. Society was hierarchical, with the
king at the top and surrounded by a competitive military elite, known as
Companions. City-dwelling Greeks, accustomed to diluting their wine with
water, were routinely horrified that Macedonians drank theirs neat. For us
today that might not seem so terrible—but the stories of both Philip and his
son Alexander indulging in binge drinking and drunken violence with their
Companions are too frequent and too well-attested to ignore. These were
not so much individual character traits as part of the culture of the
Macedonian court.
On the other hand, there is good evidence that the Greek language had
been spreading northwards from Greek-speaking Thessaly since the eighth
century BCE. By the time of Philip II, not only the Macedonian royal house
but also their elite, at the very least, had been giving their sons and
daughters Greek names for several generations. Many of the most
characteristic Macedonian names are transparently formed from Greek
words. Among them are some of the most famous: Philip (‘Horse-Loving’),
Cleopatra (‘Father’s Fame’), Ptolemy (‘Warlike’). Whatever languages or
dialects may once have been spoken among the people over whom they
ruled, the highest levels of Macedonian society were thoroughly Greekspeaking by the mid-fourth century BCE. And wherever the elite led, the
rest could be expected to follow. Macedonia, in other words, was rapidly
becoming Greek.21
Philip led the way more vigorously than any Macedonian king had done
before him. Under his rule, Macedonian centres of population began to look
like Greek cities. At Aegae, the old capital now used for mostly ceremonial
purposes, at Pella, that by 400 had replaced it closer to the coast, and at

Dion on the lower slopes of Mount Olympus, colonnaded temples began to
rise, built in the manner found throughout the Greek-speaking world. At
Aegae, as well as a sumptuous new palace, Philip had a huge semicircular
theatre built right in front of it, in the Greek style. Athenian drama had been
appreciated in Macedonia since at least the end of the fifth century BCE,
when the elderly Euripides had retired there. During Philip’s reign, painters,
sculptors, and philosophers from the southern city-states, and especially
from Athens, were recruited in large numbers. The most famous of these
was Aristotle, who had studied philosophy under Plato in Athens and would
later return there to found his own school. Aristotle’s home city of Stageira
had been one of those Greek settlements on the coast of Macedonia recently
razed by Philip. But this was to prove no bar to Philip recruiting Aristotle to
become private tutor to his son, Alexander—nor to Aristotle accepting the
post.22
Most striking of all is the earliest evidence for the public use of writing in
Macedonia. This was another innovation which took place under Philip.
Along with written documents and the first public inscriptions on stone
came a choice, one that would have far-reaching implications. Once upon a
time, in the days when Greek-speaking settlements were being founded all
over the Mediterranean, each one would develop its own distinctive version
of the alphabet and proudly display its own local form of speech on stone.
But no longer. As literacy had become widespread, standardisation had set
in. By the mid-fourth century BCE, writing was reaching far beyond the
bounds of any one city-state. If you wanted your words to be intelligible
and to be read by as many people as possible, you would need to write in a
way that people would be familiar with, wherever they happened to live and
irrespective of how they spoke at home. It is not clear whether the initiative
came from Philip himself, but when Macedonians began to put pen to
papyrus and to carve words into stone for public consumption, they did so
not in their own dialect but in the Greek of Athens, known as Attic.23
The peace brokered by Philip in 346 BCE would prove short-lived. During
the next five years, most of his energies were directed eastwards, towards
conquering Thrace. Apart from city-states on the coastline that had been
founded centuries earlier by Greeks from the Aegean, Thrace lay outside

the Greek-speaking world, as its people had their own language. But once
the Macedonian army had subdued all of Thrace and reached the straits that
separate the continents of Europe and Asia, whose shores had been
thoroughly ‘colonised’ by Greeks, Philip’s interests came directly into
conflict with those of Athens. This was because the Athenians were
dependent, as ever, on supplies of grain from the Greek settlements on the
Black Sea coasts. A hostile power in control of the straits had starved
Athens into submission twice before and could well do so again. Amid this
crisis, in 341 BCE, Demosthenes even urged an alliance with the old
enemy, Persia, to head off the new one, Macedonia.24
War broke out the next year, in 340 BCE. Attempts led by Demosthenes
to recruit an Athenian-led alliance against the Macedonians met with only a
lukewarm response. Once again, the city-states of central Greece were at
loggerheads over the custodianship of Delphi. Philip had acted as arbitrator
before. Would he do so again? Appeals by rival contestants gave him the
excuse he may have been waiting for to divert his armies from Thrace and
bring them south. Panic broke out in the Athenian Assembly when news
arrived that an army of Macedonians and northern Greeks thirty thousand
strong, with two thousand cavalry, had already reached the borders of
neighbouring Boeotia. For once, so great was the emergency, Demosthenes
was able to persuade his city’s age-old rivals, the Thebans, to fight
alongside Athens to preserve both their homelands. The decisive battle was
fought at the beginning of August 338 BCE on the banks of the Cephisus
River in Boeotia, below the town of Chaeronea. On one side were the
Macedonians and their northern Greek allies. On the other, more or less
matching them in numbers, were the combined forces of Athens and
Thebes, with small contingents from a few other city-states. Sparta, as so
often now, stood aloof.
Philip won the day. As many as half the Athenians and Thebans were
either killed or taken prisoner. Demosthenes himself fought among them
and survived to deliver the public oration on the fallen back in Athens
shortly afterwards. In another speech that has been often quoted since, the
up-and-coming Athenian politician Lycurgus pronounced the obituary in
330 BCE, not only for those who had lost their lives but also for the ‘liberty
of Hellas’ that had been extinguished along with them. Even today, there

are many who date the end of ‘classical’ Greek civilisation to the battle of
Chaeronea in 338 BCE.25
It all depended on what you meant by liberty and Hellas. It had been in
the crucible of the Persian Wars that these concepts had been forged in the
first place. But Demosthenes had been prepared to cut a deal with the Great
King of Persia. The ‘liberty’ of the Greek city-states by now meant little
more than the right to annihilate one another on the battlefield in a cycle of
mutual attrition in which no one could ever win. So deeply ingrained had
the mentality of the autonomous polis become in the Greek heartland, it was
the idea of their autonomy from one another that held the deepest claim on
the loyalty of Greek citizens, trumping by some margin their shared identity
as Hellenes. ‘Hellas’ was barely even a pretext.
In any case, Philip’s actions during the weeks and months after the battle
hardly lived up to the apocalyptic tones of a Demosthenes or a Lycurgus.
Thebes was punished by having its democracy replaced by an oligarchy and
a Macedonian garrison installed to ensure good behaviour. But Athens was
spared, even though its leaders had been far more outspoken against the
Macedonians, and for far longer. Those states that had not already promised
allegiance to Philip quickly did so. Only Sparta refused. A brief punitive
expedition by Macedonian troops into Laconia had the effect of isolating
the Spartans in their heartland while leaving their city and its institutions
untouched. All the other Greek city-states were then required to send
representatives to a conference convened by Philip at Corinth. This was
where the new political settlement was handed down. It established a
military alliance and a ‘Common State (Koinon) of the Hellenes’, with rules
for its governance. Modern historians refer to this as the ‘League of
Corinth’, a name which rather misses the point of the original Greek. In
effect, the settlement prescribed a kind of federation, governed by a
representative council but with all members owing allegiance to the
‘Leader’ (the Greek word hegemon gives us the word hegemonic). Needless
to say, the Leader was to be the king of the Macedonians—meaning not just
Philip but also his heirs in perpetuity.26
Perhaps curiously, and a source of dissension to come, Macedonia itself
remained outside the federation. Politically and culturally, Philip chose to
mark a separation between his own kingdom and the wider ‘Hellas’ that for

the first time acquired a semblance of political existence under his
leadership. For long afterwards, people would continue to talk of ‘Greeks’
and ‘Macedonians’ as distinct groups, even though both together would
soon make up the nucleus of a rapidly expanding Greek-speaking world.
A second meeting of delegates, summoned from the city-states, took place
at Corinth in the spring of 337 BCE. Philip announced his intention of
leading an expedition to liberate the Greek cities of the Anatolian seaboard
from Persian rule. This was exactly what Isocrates had been preaching in
vain for so long: a united, ‘panhellenic’ expedition against the old, common
enemy. Among the last words that Isocrates ever wrote, before his death at
the age of ninety-eight, were these, addressed to the victor of Chaeronea. If
you can ‘force the barbarians into servitude to the Greeks’, he wrote to
Philip, ‘there will be nothing else left for you but to become a god’.27
Philip by this time controlled a territory that included almost all of today’s
Greece, much of Bulgaria, Albania, the Republic of North Macedonia, and
all the European part of Turkey.28 No one except Xerxes—and he only very
briefly—had ever before held so much power in this region or over so many
Greeks. True to his word, a year after his announcement to the Greek
representatives assembled at Corinth, Philip despatched the advance guard
of the promised all-Greek expedition into Persian-held territory. In the
spring of 336 BCE, three of his generals led a force across the strait of the
Dardanelles from Europe to Asia.
Presumably Philip still intended, as he had announced at Corinth, to place
himself at the head of the main force that was to follow. But he seems to
have been in no hurry. First, there was to be a royal wedding celebrated at
Aegae, the old, ceremonial capital of Macedonia. The previous year, Philip
had married for the seventh time, though several of his previous wives were
still living. Now, he was marrying off his daughter, Cleopatra, to a close
relative who was the ruler of neighbouring Epiros. All of Philip’s own
marriages, with the possible exception of the most recent, had been strictly
strategic. So was this one for his daughter. A dynastic alliance with Epiros
would neutralise a potential threat to his rear while he was away
campaigning in Asia.

It would also neutralise a threat closer to home. His estranged fourth wife,
Olympias, was not only the mother of the bride and sister of the groom but
also belonged to the royal family of Epiros. This mattered because
Olympias was the mother of Philip’s chosen heir, the twenty-year-old
Alexander. Philip and Alexander had quarrelled violently during the past
year, apparently over Philip’s own latest marriage to a girl closer to his
daughter in age. The quarrel had been patched up, at least on the surface, by
the summer of 336 BCE. But Alexander, who had led one of the charges at
Chaeronea when aged only eighteen, had not been included in the
expedition that had been sent across the Dardanelles. Philip was laying his
plans carefully. While he had been away on a previous campaign, he had
appointed his young heir to manage the kingdom during his absence. This
was the role he seems to have been planning for Alexander once again.
The wedding took place at Aegae (modern Vergina) in either July or
October 336 BCE. It was in every sense a state occasion. Guests were
invited from every corner of the Greek world and beyond. The morning
after the ceremony, the recently completed theatre was packed—which
implies an audience of many thousands—for the entertainment that had
been promised. Despite hard drinking the night before, the festivities were
due to begin at sunrise. In procession, statues of the twelve gods of
Olympus were wheeled or carried into the circular space in front of the
tiered seats. Along with them came a thirteenth, representing Philip himself.
Whatever exactly was meant by this, it was the kind of statement that up to
this time Greeks, however vainglorious, had always stopped short of
making. To traditional ways of thinking, there was a line between mortal
men and the immortal gods that no mere human, no matter how powerful,
could safely try to cross. Behind the procession came Philip’s son and heir,
Alexander, walking with the bridegroom, then Philip himself, dressed all in
white. The royal bodyguard, ordered by Philip to hang back for the
occasion, followed at a discreet distance.
What followed must surely qualify for the most theatrical murder ever
staged. As Philip entered the open space in front of the assembled
spectators, a former member of his bodyguard rushed up to him, drew a
concealed dagger, and plunged it into the king’s chest. Philip died on the
spot. The assassin ran for the city gates, where there were horses waiting.
He would have got away, so the story goes, but he tripped over a trailing

vine as he was trying to mount. Three of the king’s guards caught up with
him and killed him before he could speak.29
Philip had been murdered in broad daylight, in front of witnesses
numbered in the thousands. No one could doubt the identity of the
murderer. His name was Pausanias. The official story was that he had
harboured a grudge, not directly against his king but against one of his
courtiers, and Philip had refused him redress. But Pausanias did not act
alone, as the detail of the getaway horses proves. The convenient vine that
tripped him as he was preparing to mount suggests that he was never meant
to get away. Even Alexander entertained no doubts that Pausanias had been
part of a plot. Those would be the very grounds on which the new king
would have several potential rivals for the throne executed in the next few
days or weeks, as supposedly complicit.30
Speculation has been rife ever since. Ancient authors suspected
Alexander’s mother, Philip’s estranged wife Olympias. Some also,
circumspectly, even though they were writing hundreds of years after the
event, thought that Alexander himself might have been implicated. Modern
historians have returned to the issue—a classic murder mystery with a trail
that had already gone cold more than two thousand years ago. Many of
them entertain the possibility that Olympias, or Alexander, or both, may
have given Pausanias his instructions. No one doubts that the chief
beneficiary of Philip’s death, at that particular time, was the twenty-year-old
who would very shortly afterwards be crowned Alexander III, King of the
Macedonians—later to be known the world over as ‘Alexander the Great’.31
No new evidence is ever going to come to light that would prove the
matter one way or the other. But the manner of the crime has Alexander’s
fingerprints all over it. Everything we know about Alexander’s life and
deeds, both before and after the event, shows an audacity that is still, after
so long, breathtaking. Time and again, he would respond to a challenge that
everyone else thought impossible and succeed—through ingenuity, physical
endurance, sheer delight in risk for its own sake, as well as, surely, an
extraordinary run of luck. This is the well-rehearsed story of the most
audacious military commander, probably of all time, who spent most of his
short life on campaign and never lost a battle. Everything that Alexander
did, from his taming of the unbreakable horse Bucephalas in his early teens

to the legendary cutting of the Gordian knot and innumerable exploits
against towns and fortresses built in remote and inaccessible places, betrays
the same ruthlessness and the same determination to succeed at any cost,
whether to himself or to others.32
Almost everything that Alexander ever did was done in public, more or
less explicitly performed for show. This was as true of his most celebrated
triumphs as it was of those acts that even his most devoted biographers,
ancient and modern, have deplored. He would develop a track record for
eliminating some of the individuals who had been closest to him and to
whom he owed the most. A comrade who had saved his life in battle would
be rewarded by being run through with a pike during a drunken brawl, in
front of an assembled company. Others, after serving with him for years,
would be judicially murdered, often horribly and always in public, on the
flimsiest of pretexts.33 To commit the ultimate crime in Greek eyes, the
killing of one’s own father, in a public place, onstage before a huge
audience drawn from all over the Greek world, while also being physically
present, with his own hands perfectly clean—and to get away with it.…
Was not that the ultimate test and proof of the psychopathic genius that
Alexander would go on to display throughout his life?
In Aegae, a very public wedding had turned into a very public funeral.
Philip’s body was cremated, then the remaining bones were washed in wine,
wrapped in a purple cloak, and placed inside a casket of solid gold
emblazoned on the lid with the Macedonian emblem of the sunburst. When
the tomb was opened by the archaeologist Manolis Andronikos in 1977,
with all its treasures intact, forensic examination of the remains inside the
casket revealed that they had belonged to a man in his forties (Philip died at
forty-six), with signs of trauma around the right eye and one leg shorter
than the other. These details are consistent with the injuries that Philip is
known to have suffered in battle. Although doubts have been cast by some
archaeologists, it is almost certain that the ‘Tomb of Philip’, that lies
beneath the reconstructed ‘Royal Tumulus’ on the edge of the Greek market
town of Vergina, is indeed the last resting place of Philip II. Alexander
himself must have been present at the obsequies and have overseen every
detail of what has been preserved.34

The new king was now ruler over all the lands and peoples that had been
subdued by his father. But to secure his position, it was not enough to
eliminate those members of Philip’s inner circle who could possibly present
a threat in future. Alexander lost no time in making his mark and facing
down any actual or potential revolts on several fronts. His first move was to
forestall any reassertion of independence by the Greek city-states. The
Athenian delegation to the wedding at Aegae had unctuously given an
assurance that there would never be a safe haven in their city for anyone
who dared to plot against Philip. But no sooner was Philip dead, and the
news arrived in Athens, than Demosthenes led jubilant celebrations in the
Assembly.35 And it was not just in Athens that this happened. Other states
were restive too. So Alexander’s first move was to reconvene the
conference at Corinth. His father’s tomb had probably only just been sealed
when he headed south. But this was to be more than a diplomatic mission.
Or rather, it would define Alexander’s future ideas of diplomacy. He
travelled south at the head of a large Macedonian army.
The Thebans and the Athenians panicked when they found the victors of
Chaeronea back, in strength, on the borders of their territory. But Alexander
had made his point. So long as they obeyed his orders and sent their
representatives to a new meeting at Corinth, their citizens were in no danger
from his army. Once the delegates from all the city-states had assembled, he
reaffirmed the settlement that his father had handed down two years before
and his own position as hegemon. Only the Spartans continued to sulk.
They sent no delegates nor recognised the terms. Alexander ignored them.
The expedition against the Persians would still go ahead, he announced. All
the Greek city-states were to contribute troops. They should make
preparations and be ready. In the meantime, Alexander had another war to
wage, against the Illyrians, Macedonia’s northern neighbours. And so he
headed north again with his army in the spring of 335 BCE.36
Then, a few months later, came news that he was dead, killed on
campaign. Once again, rejoicing flickered through the Greek states like
wildfire. This time it was Thebes that took the lead, declaring a struggle in
the name of ‘liberty’ and a mission to ‘throw off the Macedonian yoke’.37
But Alexander was not dead. He arrived outside Thebes, at the head of an
army, with characteristic swiftness. In the event, the Thebans stood alone in

their defiance, although they had many sympathisers, including
Demosthenes and most of the Athenians. When the defenders refused to
back down, Alexander’s troops took Thebes by storm. Once the battle was
over, Alexander determined to make an example of Thebes. The warning
was all the more effective because it was carried out in the name of the
‘Common State of the Hellenes’, whose representatives had to sign up to it.
The citadel of Thebes was razed to the ground. Only the house that had
once belonged to the poet Pindar was spared, as a mark of respect. Some six
thousand Thebans were killed and thirty thousand sold into slavery. Once
again, the Athenians were fearful that they would be next; once again they
were spared. Alexander would never greatly trust the Athenians—and with
good reason, as later events would prove. But at this point he needed them
as more or less willing allies if he was to justify his invasion of Asia as
revenge for the depredations of the Persian Wars.38
By the spring of 334 BCE, everything was ready. All through the
preceding winter, contingents summoned from the Greek city-states had
been mustering in Macedonia. The advance guard of Macedonian troops,
that had been sent to Anatolia by Philip, was coming under increasing
pressure from the new Great King of Persia. Darius III had come to the
throne at about the same time as Philip’s assassination, and was very
effectively beginning to assert his authority. If the Macedonians were to
stay in the field against him, they would have to be reinforced soon.
Alexander led his army from Amphipolis, in Macedonia, to the Dardanelles
in just twenty days. Then, while the whole army and its baggage train were
being ferried across the straits, he took time to visit the site of ancient Troy.
It suited his purpose to present himself as the new Achilles, the ‘best of the
Achaeans’, according to Homer in the Iliad. His would be the destiny to
carry forward the age-old conflict between Europe and Asia that (according
to Herodotus, not Homer) had begun with that legendary war.39
The full force of Greeks and Macedonians that came together on the
Asian side of the Dardanelles may have reached as many as fifty thousand
men. It included an elite cavalry numbering about five thousand. Compared
to estimates of the amphibious forces that Xerxes had once led in the
opposite direction, the size was quite modest. Alexander would soon get
used to his forces being heavily outnumbered in each of their major battles.

But this was the largest army that had ever come together under Greek
command.40 The greatest adventure in the whole of Greek history, and
surely one of the greatest in the history of the world, was about to begin.
The Persians had moved too slowly either to hinder the crossing of the
Dardanelles or to prevent Alexander’s forces from joining up with the
Macedonians already on the Asian side. But they were not far away. Battle
was joined a few miles inland from the southern shore of the Sea of
Marmara. A steep-banked river then called the Granicus presented a natural
obstacle that the Persians could exploit to halt the Greek advance. This was
the first of four set-piece battles fought during the next eight years that
would determine the course of the campaign. At one point, Alexander came
close to losing his life. But in the end the Persians were pushed back across
the river. Their retreat turned into a rout. The invaders had won the day.
After it was over, Alexander sent a trophy to Athens, to be dedicated to
the city’s patron goddess, Athena. Accompanying it was the inscribed
legend, ‘Alexander, son of Philip, and the Hellenes, excluding the
Lacedaemonians, dedicate these spoils, taken from the barbarians who
dwell in Asia’.41 It was the old opposition writ large: between Hellenes and
barbarians, between Europe and Asia. But there was a barb, too. The
‘Lacedaemonians’—the Spartans—were the only Greeks who had refused
to join Philip’s ‘Common State’ or to subscribe to the expedition. The
Spartans had also, not long before, been the bitterest rivals of the Athenians.
And the trophy itself consisted of precisely three hundred captured suits of
armour. This had been the number of Spartans killed during the defence of
the pass of Thermopylae in 480 BCE, remembered ever since as the most
heroic act of self-sacrifice during the Persian Wars. Alexander’s dedication
to the patron goddess of Athens was the ultimate snub to Sparta. The
military machine that had humbled Athens in the Peloponnesian War had
become simply irrelevant.
In the same spirit, though far more chilling in modern eyes, was the
savagery shown to the sizeable force of Greek mercenaries who had fought
in the battle on the Persian side. During the battle itself, Alexander had
given orders for this contingent to be surrounded and ‘butchered to a man’.
Despite this, some two thousand survived to be taken captive. To make an

example of them, Alexander had them sent back to Macedonia in chains
and put to hard labour. The conference at Corinth had expressly forbidden
citizens of member-states from enlisting in foreign armies.42 So
Alexander’s behaviour could still be seen as the legitimate actions of the
hegemon of the Common State of the Hellenes. Even the harshness of the
methods was scarcely out of the ordinary by the standards of traditional
Greek interstate warfare. But the episode also dramatically highlights how
far Alexander’s expedition was from being anything like a Greek ‘crusade’,
as is often claimed. More Greeks actually fought on the Persian side against
him than under his banner. Often disparagingly called ‘mercenaries’, these
paid soldiers were in many cases exiles from their own cities or, like the
survivors of the destruction of Thebes, implacable enemies of the
Macedonians by conviction. The Common State was very far from being
able to claim the allegiance of all Hellenes.43
By the autumn of 334 BCE, Alexander’s army had traversed the entire
Aegean seaboard of Anatolia and had reached the south coast. The work of
liberating the Greek cities was already done—even though some of them,
notably Miletus and what had been Herodotus’s hometown of
Halicarnassus, had put up resistance and had to be ‘liberated’ by force. At
the end of the year, Alexander turned inland and made for the heart of
Anatolia. It was at the ancient Phrygian city of Gordium, not far from
today’s Ankara, that he is supposed to have ‘cut the Gordian knot’.
Centuries before, this knot had been tied so intricately that no one could
undo it; anyone who succeeded, according to a local prophecy, would
become master of the entire Persian Empire. Alexander’s solution, so the
story goes, was to slice through the ropes with his sword. The places he was
passing through, by this stage of the expedition, had previously lain on the
outer fringes of the Greek world. As he resumed the march next spring,
Alexander was leading his troops ever farther from that world and from the
political arrangements that his father had set up for its governance.
The second great battle was fought in November 333 BCE on the south
coast of today’s Turkey at a place the Greeks called Issus. Darius III led his
troops in person this time. When he fled the battle, his camp followers and
much of his baggage train fell into the Macedonians’ hands. In this way
Alexander took captive Darius’s mother, one of his wives, and two of his

daughters. For centuries afterwards, he would earn praise for his treatment
of these royal captives, which a later age would have called ‘chivalrous’.
Darius then offered peace terms, but Alexander rejected them. He himself
was the new ‘King of all Asia’. ‘Everything you possess is now mine,’ he
wrote back haughtily. If Darius disagreed, he would have to come back and
fight another day.44
That day would come two years later, when the two armies once again
faced each other, this time on the plains of today’s Iraqi Kurdistan, not far
from Mosul and the site of the ancient city of Nineveh. By this time, Darius
was prepared to hand over to Alexander the entire western half of his
empire, up to the River Euphrates, as well as his daughter in marriage and
an enormous ransom for his other captured family members.45 But
Alexander was not interested in making peace. His expedition had already
crossed the Euphrates, and the Tigris beyond it, to reach Gaugamela, where
the battle would be fought. Alexander had used the time in between to win
two famous sieges, of Tyre and Gaza, and massacre most of the survivors
among those who had resisted. He had also annexed from Persia the whole
of Egypt, with the willing support of its people, and paid a visit to an oracle
at the remote oasis of Siwah in the Libyan Desert. There, the priest may or
may not have told him that he was the son of Zeus, whom the Egyptians
worshipped under the name of Amun. Before leaving Egypt, it is said that
he laid out the ground plan for a new city on the Mediterranean coast to be
named after him—Alexandria.
At Gaugamela, on 1 October 331, Alexander faced his largest opposing
force yet. This was the first time that the Greek cavalry encountered war
elephants, recruited from Darius’s easternmost provinces. But once again,
the enemy was routed. Darius escaped with his life but would soon be
treacherously murdered by his own side. Alexander’s way was now open to
Babylon, one of the greatest cities of the ancient world, and Susa, the
administrative capital of the Persian Empire. In both cities he seems to have
been acclaimed as the new, legitimate Great King of Persia.46 He then
fought his way south to Persepolis, the Greek name for the empire’s old
ceremonial centre. Before Alexander was done there, his troops set fire to
the sumptuous palace of the Persian kings and a large part of it was
destroyed. According to one version of events, the fire was started by

Alexander himself, by accident during a drunken rampage. Another
presents it as a calculated act of revenge for the burning of Athens by
Xerxes and Mardonius. Shortly afterwards, Alexander dismissed from his
command all the troops from the Greek alliance that had followed him thus
far. Those who wished to enlist for further conquests were invited to do so
as mercenaries. And some did. The rest went home.47
In the eyes of those who continued to follow him, Alexander’s goals from
this point on became harder and harder to understand. The historians on
whose words we rely for our information, most of them writing in Greek
several hundred years later, were just as puzzled, as indeed are we today.
Was it an insatiable desire for conquest that led Alexander on, now that all
his readily understood objectives had been achieved? Or was there a
rational plan? Was his undoubted tactical military brilliance harnessed to a
strategic political mind and a longer-term purpose?
Alexander left Persepolis in May 330 BCE. For the next four and a half
years, he led his armies north and east to the shores of the Caspian Sea and
far into modern Afghanistan, then south, to cross the River Indus into the
Punjab. The last of the great battles of the campaign was fought on the
banks of the River Jhelum, in today’s Pakistan, in May 326. The enemy this
time was the rajah of the Pauravas, a gigantic figure of a man whom the
Greeks called Porus. His army included the largest contingent of war
elephants that the expedition had yet faced. Despite the elephants, Porus
lost; Alexander allowed him to keep his kingdom in return for his future
allegiance.
Shortly afterwards, the expedition reached its farthest point. Camp had
been pitched on the bank of the River Hyphasis, now the River Beas, in
northwest India, probably not far from Amritsar. All the ancient sources
agree on what happened next. Alexander wanted to go on. There was more
rich land to be conquered, between here and the next even greater river, the
Ganges. Beyond that, Greeks believed at the time, must lie the river called
Ocean, that marked the ultimate boundary of the inhabited earth. Alexander
urged his men to follow him onwards, to create an empire that ‘will have no
boundaries but what God Himself has made for the whole world’.48
If Alexander did in fact utter those words, or something similar, it was the
only time in his life when he failed to get his way. As the story continues,

the men were implacable. They would go no farther. After sulking in his
tent for three whole days, Alexander agreed to turn—not quite back, but
aside, to follow the course of the Indus downriver to the Indian Ocean.
Along the way he fought more battles, brutally imposing his authority
against anyone who dared to stand against him. Once at the coast, he
divided his forces, sending one half by sea up the Arabian Gulf and into the
strait of Hormuz, while he himself led the land force by a punishing route
through the deserts of Baluchistan.
This is the Alexander of legend, the world conqueror who would never
have stopped unless he had been forced to. The story may well be true. No
ancient source contradicts it, and most modern historians take it at face
value. But it has been suggested that Alexander’s motivation may have been
more calculated. According to this alternative view, the path of Alexander’s
conquests followed the traditional boundaries of the Persian Empire at its
greatest extent—so far and no farther. His strategic and political objective
would therefore have been to assert his personal authority over all the farflung domains of the empire that he had conquered with the defeat of
Darius. If this was so, then his one and only reported defeat, by his own
subordinates on the banks of the Hyphasis, was no such thing, and the
return via the Indus and Baluchistan had already been part of the plan.49
Alexander arrived back at the Persian capital, Susa, in the spring of 324
BCE. Apart from a brief campaign against a rebel movement the following
winter, he concentrated on the administration of his empire. Evidently, it
had never been his intention simply to put his own people in charge of the
lands they had conquered, still less to impose Greek or Macedonian ways
upon them. To some extent like the Persian kings before him, and very
much as the Romans would later do on an even larger scale, Alexander
went out of his way to win over the local ruling class in each region and to
exercise control through them.
A constant complaint by contemporaries and by later Greek historians was
that their hero demeaned himself when he conferred titles and
responsibilities on defeated ‘barbarians’, and himself adopted ‘barbarian’
ways of dressing and behaving. But what looked like ‘going over to the
enemy’ and the self-aggrandisement of a ‘tyrant’ or an oriental despot (all
traditional terms of abuse in the ancient Greek world) have seemed to

modern historians more like the signs of a far-reaching programme for
cultural and political fusion.50 The empire that Alexander was busy
consolidating in 324 BCE was not conceived as a Greek empire. It may well
have been a first—ever—attempt at global supremacy, deliberately
transcending the boundaries of ethnicities, cultures, and identities. But, even
though Alexander had probably never had any such intention, the effect of
his conquests was already, visibly, to carry Greek ideas, Greek ways of
doing and making things, and above all the Greek language far inland from
the places where they had started out, across the Asian landmass as far as
today’s Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the northwestern corner of
India.
The result can be compared to the spread of ‘global English’ since the
nineteenth century of our own era—and it came about for very much the
same reasons. Just as English is spoken and written all over the world today
by millions of people of very many different backgrounds and ethnicities,
so the Koine (or ‘Common Greek’) of Alexander’s day, based on the
prestige dialect of classical Athens, was already taking root as a universal
language of government, commerce, and culture.
Meanwhile, back in Athens itself, the years when Alexander was storming
through the east were a time of remarkable cultural investment. Ever since
the exemplary destruction of Thebes in 335 BCE, the world of the Greek
city-states had experienced an almost unprecedented interval of peace. The
settlement laid down by Philip after the battle of Chaeronea seemed to be
working well. True, there had been a revolt by Sparta in 331 BCE. But no
other state joined in, and the Spartans had never been part of the Common
State of the Hellenes anyway. The role of hegemon had been taken by
Antipater, the regent left behind by Alexander to rule over Macedonia.
Antipater had put down the Spartan rebellion within a year. In 324 BCE, the
peace was still holding throughout the entire Greek peninsula and the
islands of the Aegean.
Peace brought renewed prosperity. Athens was not the only city-state
whose treasury had been emptied by decades of interstate warfare. Now
revenues were flowing again. The citizen body of democratic Athens was
receptive to the big-spending ideas of their most accomplished orator and

administrator, Lycurgus. New public works were designed to impress
citizens and visitors alike. One of these was a marble stadium for the games
that were part of the regular Panathenaic Festival, the city’s local answer to
the Olympic Games. Another was the splendid new theatre, also built of
marble, on the southern slope below the Acropolis. Plays had been
performed there, in the sanctuary of Dionysus, for more than 150 years.
But, remarkably, Athens had never boasted a permanent theatre until this
time. The Theatre of Dionysus that we see today took thirty years to build
and was not finished at the time of Lycurgus’s death in 324 BCE. It seems
to have been part of a deliberate drive to establish the dramatic repertoire of
the previous century as a distinctively Athenian ‘brand’, a legacy to the
whole Greek-speaking world.51
These were the years when the philosopher Aristotle moved to Athens and
taught students in a school, known as the Lyceum, built in a shady grove on
the banks of the Ilissos River. Alexander’s former tutor would always
remain an outsider in Athens, denied the rights that came with citizenship.
Shortly before he arrived there, Aristotle’s experiments with living
organisms in a lagoon on the island of Lesbos had laid the foundation not
only for biology as a subject of scientific enquiry but also for the
experimental method which is today the basis for every branch of science.52
In Athens, in his class on philosophy, Aristotle told his students that the
goal of human life is ‘so far as possible to become immortal and to strive in
every way to live according to the finest thing that is in us’, that is,
according to reason. Alexander may really have believed he was a god and
seems to have claimed divine honours from his subjects; but his more
humane master argued instead that godhead lies within the grasp of every
human being—and without having to kill, conquer, or destroy anyone or
anything.53
At the same time, the public spaces of the Agora and the precinct of the
new Theatre of Dionysus were becoming populated on a scale never before
seen by men and women made of bronze and marble. Sculptors had devised
techniques to create a more fluid impression of bodies in motion. A softer
sensuousness was replacing the austere formality of the previous century.
The greatest Greek sculptor of the age, the Athenian Praxiteles, is reputed
to have been the first to create a female figure entirely nude—and she was

no less a personage than Aphrodite, the goddess of love. His Aphrodite of
Cnidus caused a scandal when it was first seen, perhaps around the year 330
BCE. The explicit sensuality of the pose has provoked conflicting responses
in viewers ever since.54
There must have been a sense of unreality during those years, as
Athenians and other Greeks went about these peaceful pursuits while news
kept arriving of more and more battles fought and won hundreds of miles to
the east. It was one thing to speculate about the nature of human happiness,
to catalogue and promote classic works of dramatic art, or to celebrate the
languid pleasures of the human body. But even as we still celebrate these
achievements today, it takes an effort to remember that at the time these
must have felt like stolen pleasures. Nobody in the Greek world knew
when, or whether, Alexander would return, or if he did, what he might do
next.
After he had dismissed their contingents from his army at Persepolis,
Alexander seems to have given little thought to the Greek city-states that he
had left behind. Back in Susa, early in the summer of 324 BCE, it was time
for him to take stock. The centre of gravity of his newly conquered empire
lay in Mesopotamia, not the Aegean. But then Alexander decided it was
time for the Greeks to learn where they belonged in the new order of things.
The settlement that his father had reached with them a dozen years earlier,
after the battle of Chaeronea, had been made for a different world. The fouryear cycle of the Olympic Games was about to come around again. The full
moon on 4 August would bring the great festival to its climax.55 The
sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia would be packed not only with athletes but
also with spectators and political actors drawn from the whole Greekspeaking world. Alexander had a shock in store for them.
When his envoy arrived at Olympia, he read out a document that has been
known ever since as the ‘Exiles’ Decree’. On the face of it, the decree
looked innocuous, even humanitarian. But its political implications were to
prove far-reaching. Alexander announced that every citizen who had been
deported from his home state or had lost citizen rights must now be allowed
to return. The decree also gave Antipater authority to impose its terms by
force if necessary.

To understand the full significance of this measure, we have to imagine a
world in which it was not only thinkable but also normal practice to use
deportation and deprivation of civic rights as a routine legal sanction. The
Greek world of the fourth century BCE was full of deportees. Some would
have been criminals convicted of an offence. But the great majority were
either mercenaries who had forfeited their rights back home, political exiles
who had fallen foul of the ruling faction in their city, or sometimes a whole
population that had been displaced by an act of conquest. A particularly
notorious case concerned the island of Samos, whose people had been
deported en masse to the Anatolian mainland by Athens some four decades
previously. In the summer of 324 BCE, as many as twenty thousand of
these displaced persons had found their way to Olympia for the sacred
festival. When the decree was read out, their jubilation was predictable.
For everyone else, it seemed like a recipe for chaos. What would be the
rights of people living in property confiscated from owners who had been
deported? Where were the returnees to be housed? Most shocking of all, the
decree cut right across the terms of the settlement for the Greek city-states
that had been handed down by Philip fourteen years before and
subsequently renewed by Alexander himself. There was no question of
consultation among delegates to the Corinth conference or of reconvening
that notional governing body of the Common State of the Hellenes. In
effect, the Common State was dead. In the words of one modern historian,
this was ‘the language of autocracy’.56 It also had a very specific purpose.
By this simple stroke, Alexander could ensure that every Greek city-state,
however tiny, would in future be home to a sizeable proportion of citizens
who owed their rights not to their own government but to Alexander
personally. Autocracy, indeed.
No Greek state dared defy the ruling. But several, including Athens, did
their utmost to drag their feet while they tried to negotiate exceptions. This
was still going on the following summer when news arrived in Greece:
Alexander was dead. This time, it was true. He had been taken ill in
Babylon and died there on 10 June 323 BCE, a month short of his thirtythird birthday. The cause, despite the inevitable rumours that began to
circulate shortly afterwards and have never quite been laid to rest, was
almost certainly natural.

Far from mourning the loss of the most successful military leader the
Greek world would ever know, or even celebrating his short life, the
Athenians were as jubilant as they had been at the death of Philip before
him. Secret preparations to throw off the ‘Macedonian despotism’ began as
soon as the first rumours reached the city. Once the news was confirmed,
the Assembly resolved ‘that the demos (people) should take thought for the
common liberty of the Hellenes’. Envoys were sent to potential allies to
remind them how in the past the Athenian demos had stood up for the
freedom of ‘Hellas as the common homeland of the Hellenes’ and to urge
them to fight again, now, for their ‘common deliverance’.57
It is a reliable measure of feeling among the Greek states that at least
twenty of them responded to this call. In response, Antipater led a
Macedonian force south into Greece. For a time, the Macedonians were
besieged by the rebels in the town of Lamia—hence the modern name for
the conflict, the ‘Lamian War’. But after the arrival of reinforcements from
Macedonia, the Greek states were roundly defeated at the battle of Crannon,
in Thessaly, in September 322 BCE. Antipater then imposed a separate
peace on each of the allies. The penalty for Athens was to have a
Macedonian garrison imposed. The democratic constitution was abolished
and replaced by an oligarchy. Only a cabal made up of the wealthiest
citizens would be allowed to vote in the Assembly.58 Demosthenes, whose
power of oratory and whose passionate opposition to Macedonian
expansion had dominated Athenian civil life for three decades, fled the city,
only to take poison as Antipater’s men came after him.
The story of Athens as a political and military power was finally over. But
the cultural investment by Lycurgus and his contemporaries would prove its
worth in the long run. Athens from this time on would fulfil the prophecy of
Isocrates to become the cultural capital of a whole new, vastly expanded
Greek-speaking world. So new would that world turn out to be, and so
different the civilisation it would go on to produce, that today we call it not
‘Hellenic’ but ‘Hellenistic’—from a Greek word that originally meant
‘adopting Greek ways’ or ‘becoming Greek’.59

‘BECOMING GREEK’
322 BCE–27 BCE

I A
f

lexander had ever intended to create a ‘new world order’, those who

came after him failed spectacularly to see the project through. For thirty
years after his death in Babylon, his former commanders fought among
themselves—much as the Greek city-states had been doing for hundreds of
years, only on a much larger geographical scale. Indeed, everything about
the new Greek world that was emerging was gigantic compared to anything
that had gone before—from the egos of its rulers to the monumental
buildings they created and the millions of non-Greeks who were now their
subjects. Eventually, three relatively stable new kingdoms emerged, one in
each of the continents that made up the known world: Asia, Africa, and
Europe. Each kingdom would be ruled by a dynasty founded by one of
those ‘successors’, as the former commanders came to be known.1 But the
Greek-speaking world that we call ‘Hellenistic’ extended even farther, both
to the east and to the west.
Starting in the east, wherever the Macedonian armies had passed and
Alexander had left behind garrisons to protect their gains, a Greek-speaking
population remained. Almost immediately, the easternmost of these regions
was won back by the Indian king Chandragupta (Sandrakottos to Greek
historians). The dynasty he founded, the Mauryans, would go on to
dominate much of the Indian subcontinent. Those Greeks and Macedonians
who lived in the territories reconquered by Chandragupta would be
absorbed into the kingdom of his grandson, Ashoka. This king was an
enthusiastic convert to Buddhism. An inscription from Alexandria-in-

Arachosia, today’s Kandahar in Afghanistan, announces the success of the
new religion, written in two languages, one of which is Greek. Evidently,
Greek speakers were among those converted. And indeed one by the name
of Menander would play a part in the development of Indian Buddhism a
century later.2
As the Mauryan Empire in turn crumbled, new petty kingdoms emerged
in the area of today’s Pakistan. Known as ‘Indo-Greek’, the last of these
seems to have survived for a little over three hundred years. So Greek rule
in that part of the subcontinent lasted longer than the British Raj of modern
times, that ended in 1947. No one ever wrote a history of these kings or
their subjects, or if they did, their words have not come down to us. Often,
the only evidence that they had once existed lies in the coins they minted.
These are Greek in style and are stamped with the names and stylised
images of the rulers. For a time, the city of Taxila, not far from the modern
capital of Pakistan, Islamabad, was home to Greek-speaking kings and a
distinctive style of sculpture that mixes Indian with Greek techniques and
motifs. Known as Gandharan, from the name of the wider region, this art
could still produce some remarkable hybrid forms, even after the last of the
Greek kingdoms had disappeared.3
We know slightly more, but still tantalisingly little, about the Greek
speakers of Bactria. This was a region geographically equivalent to today’s
Afghanistan and the southern part of Uzbekistan. Conquered by Alexander,
Bactria would maintain its political independence as a minor Macedonian
kingdom on the fringes of the Hellenistic world for at least a century and a
half. During that time, Kandahar and Samarkand were flourishing Greek
cities. In 1966, the remains of another were discovered in eastern
Afghanistan, on the border with Tajikistan. The site is known by the modern
name of Ai Khanoum. Some of the buildings uncovered there by
archaeologists are in the Persian style; others are immediately recognisable
as Greek.
Carved on a monument at Ai Khanoum are several of the famous moral
maxims that had first been displayed in the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi,
more than two thousand miles distant. The author of the inscription
identifies himself as one Clearchus, probably to be identified with
Aristotle’s former student of that name who had gone from his native

Cyprus to study in Athens before winding up in this far corner of the Greekspeaking world. Clearchus describes how he had ‘conscientiously
transcribed’ the words in their original setting so that they would ‘shine
light even from so far away’. In another Greek inscription from
Afghanistan, a businessman who had made good after many trials tells his
story on his tombstone. ‘Sophytos, son of Naratos’, is unlikely to have
spoken Greek as his mother tongue because neither his own nor his father’s
name is Greek. But whoever composed his epitaph had a sophisticated
grasp not just of the language but of literary conventions too. Whether the
words are his own or not, it was the dead man’s express desire to turn his
life into ‘a speaking monument upon the road’. Greek, at this time and in
this place, was the natural medium for doing so.4
Then, tracking westwards, there was Mesopotamia, the ‘land between the
two rivers’, the Tigris and the Euphrates. Lying at the centre of the Fertile
Crescent, where agriculture is believed to have begun, this had been one of
the world’s most densely populated regions for several millennia already.
Susa, built on a tributary of the Tigris, had been the administrative capital
of Persia. Babylon, on the Euphrates, had once ruled over an empire of its
own and boasted one of the wonders of the ancient world, the Hanging
Gardens, supposed to have been built by its king, Nebuchadnezzar, of
biblical fame. Alexander had moved his headquarters from Susa to Babylon
shortly before his death. Uruk, farther south on the Euphrates, had an even
older history. Once the wars of succession were over, all three of these
historic cities would continue to flourish as the main centres of power of the
largest of the great Hellenistic kingdoms. Known as ‘Asia’, this kingdom
reached westwards all the way to the Mediterranean and across Anatolia to
the Aegean. The rulers of Asia were the Seleucids, the name of the dynasty
founded by Seleucus I, who proclaimed himself king (basileus) in 305
BCE.
Archaeology shows us that these historic Mesopotamian cities changed
remarkably little under the new dispensation. Babylon seems to have had
only a small Greek community, possibly restricted to its own quarter. Older
Uruk preserves no sign of Greek presence at all—other than the telltale
ubiquitous tax receipts pressed into clay, which leave no doubt about who
was in charge. Susa now had a new Greek name: ‘Seleucia-on-the-Eulaios’,

but life there seems to have carried on much as before. Greek speakers must
have been very much in the minority in such a populous region. But as if
there were not cities enough already, Seleucus went on to build new Greek
ones. In this he was followed by his son, Antiochus I. Most of these cities
were named after either Seleucus or Antiochus (Antioch-on-the-Orontes,
today’s Antakya in southern Turkey, would become the most famous).
The nearest thing the Seleucid kingdom had to an official capital was
another new foundation, Seleucia-on-the-Tigris, not far from Babylon at the
point where the two rivers come closest together and were linked by a
canal. Seleucia-on-the-Tigris very quickly grew to become home to a
hundred thousand people—between two and three times the population of
Athens in its classical heyday. All these new cities were laid out on the
same rectangular grid plan. Said to have been the brainchild of one
Hippodamus of Miletus, back in the fifth century BCE, this system of town
planning was now the hallmark of every new city throughout the Greekspeaking world.5
The language of the former Persian administration, Aramaic, continued in
use alongside Greek for official purposes. Local people adopted Greek
names, often in tandem with their original non-Greek ones. Many, perhaps
even the majority, would have been able to function in several languages—
as indeed they had been doing for centuries before this. The difference was
that the prestige language was now Greek. It was in Greek that the
Babylonian historian Berossus wrote what has been described as a
‘sophisticated history’ of the ancient city and its civilisation. Not enough of
his work survives for us to form any idea of his motives. But we must
wonder whether the impulse to write history at all did not come with
Berossus’s adopted language. At the same time, following the example of
Alexander, the Seleucids were at pains to present themselves as the
legitimate successors to the Persian rulers they had displaced. To this end,
they embarked upon a generous programme of temple building in the
traditional style in honour of the old Babylonian gods. The first Seleucus
even married a Persian queen, Apama (and named several cities after her,
too), though this would prove the exception rather than the rule.6
Out of these meetings of Greek with Babylonian minds, during the first
century of Seleucid rule came a far-reaching innovation that would ever

afterwards affect the way in which history is written and people everywhere
think about the distant past. The ancient Babylonians had measured time by
the reigns of kings. An event was recorded as having happened in the tenth
year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, for example. With the accession of
each new king, the clock started over. Similar systems were in use all over
the ancient world. Greek city-states measured time by the names of the
highest officials elected in each year. But after Seleucus I was assassinated
in 281 BCE, the record keepers in Babylon kept the clock running. Time,
from then on, was measured not by the year of each new reign but by the
years that had passed since Seleucus had first gained control of his
kingdom. This was in 312 BCE (seven years before he took the title of
king). It was the first ever universal system for measuring historical time.7
Fifteen hundred miles to the west, and stretching far to the south into
Africa, lay the second in size of the three great ‘successor’ kingdoms,
Egypt. It was also by far the richest. This time, there was no question about
where the centre of power lay. From its foundation by Alexander in 331
BCE to the time when his former general, Ptolemy, took the title of king in
305 BCE, Alexandria had grown exponentially to become a brand new,
purpose-built capital city, comparable to Saint Petersburg in the eighteenth
century or New Delhi or Brasilia in the twentieth. In size and in commercial
importance relative to the rest of the country, Alexandria for the first
thousand years of its existence far outstripped such modern equivalents as
Washington, DC, Canberra, and Ankara.
Egypt had been a prosperous, developed, and relatively stable kingdom
for some two millennia before this time. The land and its people were
intimately connected with the Nile, whose annual flooding brought both
fertile silt and the means of irrigation to make agriculture productive. But
Alexander’s decision to build a city on the coast, close to the westernmost
mouth of the river, suddenly turned the geography of the kingdom on its
head. The new Macedonian rulers built a canal between the river delta and
the sea, in this way connecting the ancient Egyptian artery of trade with
Greek networks that reached across the Mediterranean.8
Before long, the city’s population would rise to about a million, making it
one of the largest anywhere in the world at the time. The Ptolemies could

command wealth to lavish on public projects that had been unimaginable in
the straitened conditions of the mountains or islands of the Greek heartland.
The new fashion for enormous size was spectacularly manifested in the
lighthouse built during the first half of the third century BCE on the island
of Pharos, overlooking two newly constructed harbours. Named after the
island and rising to something over three hundred feet in height, the
lighthouse remained for centuries one of the tallest buildings in the world—
topped only by the Great Pyramid at Giza.9 But unlike a famous monument
to a long-dead pharaoh, this new skyscraper had a practical function: to
guide ships safely to port. Safer trading would be more lucrative, making
the huge investment in manpower and resources also an economic one. The
Pharos would stand for almost a millennium and a half until an earthquake
caused much of it to fall into the harbour, where divers would discover the
remains in the 1990s. Long before that, what was left on land was reused in
the fifteenth century to build the Qaitbay fortress that dominates the
seaward skyline of Alexandria today.
On the mainland, on the seafront opposite the lighthouse, an extravagant
complex of buildings housed the royal palace. It used to be thought that the
foundations of these must lie beneath the modern city, which still preserves
much of the original street plan. But thanks to excavations that began in the
1990s, we now know that the sea level and shoreline have changed
dramatically since the time of the Ptolemies. The monumental architecture
of their palace and other public buildings has begun to yield treasures from
beneath the sea.10 Included in the palace complex was a sanctuary dedicated
to the nine Muses, the divine powers that had once inspired Homer and
Hesiod and that were credited by the Greeks with being the source of every
form of imaginative creativity—in the sciences as well as the arts. The
name of the sanctuary, Mouseion, has passed into many of today’s
languages with the sense of ‘museum’. But the colonnades of the original
Mouseion seem to have been empty of exhibits. In modern terms this
creation of Ptolemy I was more like a research institute or a learned society.
Alongside the Mouseion was the famous Library of Alexandria, the first
of its kind in the world. Scholars based there invented the discipline of
establishing authoritative texts from among the dozens, or even hundreds,
of competing versions available, commenting on them, elucidating their

obscurities—and above all, cataloguing them. Alexandrian scholarship has
ever since been caricatured as being as dry as the sand of the Egyptian
desert. There was much more to it than that. But it is true that Alexandrians
had a passion for making lists and classifying things. And it is also true that
everything they collected, preserved, and catalogued was written in Greek.
What can have been the motive behind such an exclusive, and indeed
expensive, fixation upon things Greek? Why invest on such a scale in
commemorating and promoting cultural achievements that were not even
native to their own kingdom of Macedonia but that belonged to the much
more widely diffused Greek-speaking world? A rather crude but not
unreasonable answer might be that Macedonia, world conqueror though it
had proved itself to be, had nothing comparable of its own to offer. In any
case, it was an astute move. And it brought results. Just as the famous
lighthouse served as a beacon for trading ships, so the Mouseion and the
library together performed the same function, for centuries, as a beacon to
attract talent from every part of the Hellenistic world. And the research that
went on there was by no means confined to what we would call the arts and
humanities.11
Eratosthenes of Cyrene, a polymath and one of the first directors of the
library, came from a long-established Greek-speaking city on the coast of
today’s Libya, that had been absorbed into the Ptolemies’ kingdom.
Eratosthenes was the first to use a scientific method to calculate the
circumference of the earth by comparing the angle of the sun’s shadow
measured simultaneously at two points on the same longitude but separated
by the length of the kingdom, from Alexandria to Aswan. And the answer
that he came up with was very close to being right.
From the Asian shore of the Bosphorus came Herophilus of Chalcedon;
from the Aegean island off the coast of Attica, Erasistratus of Keos.
Working at the Library of Alexandria under the patronage of the first two
Ptolemies, these two Greek speakers were the first anatomists to base their
research on the dissection of human bodies. Exactly what they learned
remains unclear. But they certainly added to the accumulation of medical
knowledge that would be bequeathed to the modern world—along with
issues of medical ethics that are still with us. Cutting up dead people for
research would soon, once again, become taboo until well into the

nineteenth century. And it seems that not all of the bodies cut up by these
early anatomists, with the blessing of their royal patrons, were dead.12
The Ptolemies proved remarkably successful in progressively establishing
Greek as the chief (though never the only) language of culture and
communication throughout Egypt for a thousand years—long after their
dynasty had been extinguished. This was the climate in which an Egyptian
priest by the name of Manetho, during the reign of one of the early
Ptolemies, wrote the history of his own people in Greek, just as Berossus
would do in Babylon. Although his work has survived only through later
excerpts and summaries, it remains today an invaluable source of
information about the much older history of Egypt under the pharaohs.
And it may have been under the patronage of Ptolemy II that the Torah,
the sacred scriptures of the Jews, began to be translated into Greek. This
was the beginning of the corpus that would later become known to
Christians as the Old Testament and that is today the oldest surviving
witness to the ancient Hebrew scriptures. Some believe that the translations
were made for the benefit of Jews who had settled in Alexandria and were
rapidly adopting the Greek language, while keeping faith with their own
distinctive religion. But there is also a story, dating from the second century
BCE, that Ptolemy wanted a version that would be accessible to his own
scholars working in the Alexandrian library. If this is true, it would show an
openness to other cultures not otherwise in evidence in the activities of the
library that we know about. But whatever the original motivation for these
translations, their existence testifies to the unassailable position of the
Greek language in Hellenistic Alexandria.13
Not that the Ptolemies were indifferent to the people who made up the
great majority of their subjects, or their traditions. Beginning with
Alexander himself, and just like the Seleucids in Mesopotamia, the
Macedonian rulers of Egypt went to great pains to present themselves as the
legitimate successors to the native rulers whose role they had usurped. In
this case, that meant the pharaohs, whose dynasties were traced by Manetho
back to the time of the first pyramids. Some of the best-preserved temples
of the Egyptian gods, carved images, and inscriptions in hieroglyphics, the
oldest form of Egyptian writing, that can still be seen along the course of

the Nile today were in fact either first built or newly restored during the
centuries of Macedonian rule.
Alexandria was something of a special case: native Egyptians, like the
Jews, had their own quarter in the city and were clearly a minority.
Egyptian antiquities and ancient Egyptian rituals seem to have been given
less prominence in the capital than elsewhere. But they had their place even
there. We know this from some of the finds made by archaeologists
working in recent decades on the seabed in the Eastern Harbour of
Alexandria. These include statues of Egyptian gods that were already more
than a thousand years old before anyone ever lived on this bare stretch of
desert shore. They had been brought by barge down the Nile from temples
hundreds of miles away to adorn the royal palace of the Ptolemies.14
All this added up to a curious blend that was neither quite ‘cultural
apartheid’ nor cultural fusion. Entirely typical was the practice first
established by Ptolemy II when he married his own sister, Arsinoe, and
made her his queen in 274 BCE. Marriage between royal brothers and
sisters had been part of the ancient mystique of the pharaohs. For Greeks,
on the other hand, incest of any kind had only ever been allowed for the
gods of Olympus, who could do anything, even those things that they
punished in mortals—as witness the story of Oedipus, hounded by the gods
for marrying his mother, even in ignorance. But learned Alexandrian
courtiers took the incestuous royal marriage of Ptolemy Philadelphus
(‘Sibling-Loving’) in their stride. From that time on, most of the Ptolemies
would marry within the family—at a stroke burnishing their credentials as
true Egyptian rulers while actually ensuring the exclusivity of their
Macedonian bloodline.15
By comparison with the regularly planned wide boulevards of Alexandria,
bustling with horse-drawn wheeled traffic, Athens in the middle of the third
century BCE was described by a contemporary visitor as having ‘narrow
and winding’ streets, ‘as they were all built long ago’. The water supply
was poor and food scarce unless you could afford exorbitant prices. True,
the same visitor concedes, in the city you will also ‘see the most beautiful
sights on earth’, among them the temples on the Acropolis and the recently
completed Theatre of Dionysus. But even so, he warns his readers, ‘a

stranger would find it hard to believe at first sight that this was the famous
city of Athens’.16
Indeed, despite the grandeur of its public buildings, Athens had been
reduced to a shadow of its former self. Inexorably, political power was
draining upwards, towards the third of the successor kingdoms, Macedonia.
There, the descendants of another of Alexander’s commanders, Antigonus
Monophthalmus (‘One-Eyed’), were in charge and known as the
Antigonids. The actual arrangements in force at any one time and the
precise relationship between the city of Athens and whichever king was in
power in Macedonia were in a constant state of flux, particularly during the
early years of the century. Outwardly, the forms and the locutions of
democracy, abolished after the defeat at Crannon in 322 BCE, had soon
been restored and would more often than not be maintained thereafter. We
know this from the many decrees and proclamations that were inscribed on
stone for all to read. But how truly democratic was Athens at this time? The
reality seems to have been that the self-determination of a few thousand
citizens, acting (theoretically) as a body, was no longer a political force
capable of directing events except at the most local level. The dynamics of
a citizen assembly, galvanised by a charismatic individual such as
Themistocles or Pericles, that had guided Athens through the Persian and
Peloponnesian Wars, had become an anachronism in a Greek-speaking
world that operated on the scale of the new kingdoms. Athenians still went
through the motions. But that is all they were.17
In the face of these realities, Athenians continued to talk and to write
down what they said and thought. Very little of what they wrote during the
third century BCE has survived—in part, no doubt, because decisions about
what was worthy to be preserved for the future were now being taken by the
librarians of Alexandria. The most influential innovation of the time was a
new style of comedy. In place of the bawdy humour and topical satire that
had been the staples of Aristophanes and the earlier Athenian comic
dramatists, New Comedy was tightly plotted. The action of these plays is
built around a limited number of stock situations and characters. Romantic
young lovers overcome all obstacles to win through to a happy ending. In
melodramatic twists, long-lost family members turn up and are recognised.
Along the way, the audience would be entertained by running repartee

between masters and their wise-cracking slaves. From its beginnings in
Athens, New Comedy would spread during the third century BCE right
across the Greek-speaking world.18
In philosophy, too, Athens continued to lead. The schools that had been
founded by Plato and Aristotle in the previous century were still
flourishing, while new ones emerged to rival them. These were ‘schools’ in
the double sense of institutions that involved an element of instruction, and
‘schools of thought’, which perpetuated the ideas of the original founders.
But the quest for universal truths, or the highest purpose of human life, gave
way to a more utilitarian approach. The new philosophy that emanated from
Athens was designed to teach people how to make the most of their lives in
the situations in which they found themselves. According to Epicurus,
active in Athens until his death in 270 BCE, the secret was to make the best
of life’s good things. Zeno, from Citium in Cyprus, would gather an
audience in the Painted Stoa (a kind of shopping arcade) in the Athenian
marketplace during the same years and tell them, on the contrary, to
minimise the worst. The followers of these two men would be known
respectively ever afterwards as Epicureans and Stoics (after the arcade).
Both alike envisaged a world ruled by gods who are remote and
indifferent. Both agreed that any kind of concerted action by groups or by
society as a whole is ultimately futile. Instead, the key to happiness and
fulfilment lies in what we would call a psychological attitude on the part of
the individual. Crucially, they believed, this can be acquired by teaching
and practice. Modern stereotypes brand Epicureans as seekers after sensual
pleasure, often associated with the motto, ‘Eat, drink, and be merry, for
tomorrow we die’. By contrast, the word ‘stoical’ has entered the languages
of today to describe patient endurance in the face of suffering. In reality, the
teachings of both schools, as we know them from later times, were a great
deal more nuanced than those stereotypes. Stoicism, in particular, would
become hugely influential in the ancient world for the next eight hundred
years. Some Stoic beliefs and practices would even lay the foundations for
aspects of Christianity. But unlike a religious faith based on revelation, both
philosophies were founded on a principle that was deeply ingrained in all
ancient Greek philosophy: the way to truth was through the exercise of
reason and rational judgement.19

Athens and the Greek peninsula marked the western limit of the three
great Hellenistic kingdoms that had come into existence in the wake of
Alexander’s conquests. But the Greek-speaking world of the third century
BCE did not end there. Farther west, Greek cities were still thriving on the
coasts of Sicily and all over the toe and heel of Italy. Beyond Italy, Massalia
(today’s Marseille) was still very much a going concern and a Greek one at
that. The greatest of the Greek cities in the western Mediterranean was now
Syracuse. Not to be outdone by the new kings when they divided up the
domains that had been won by Alexander, in 304 BCE the ‘tyrant’ of
Syracuse also took the title of king (basileus).20
Ever since the time of the Persian Wars far to the east in the early fifth
century BCE, the Greek city-states of Sicily had been fighting off their
rivals, the Carthaginians, with varying success. Carthage, in modern
Tunisia, had grown from its origins as a Phoenician settlement on a par with
many others scattered throughout the western Mediterranean to become the
most powerful state in the region. By the time that Syracuse became
officially a monarchy on the Hellenistic model, Sicily had been effectively
divided between the Greeks in the east of the island and the Carthaginians
in the west.
During the century that followed, Syracuse would become the birthplace
of two of the leading figures in Hellenistic poetry and science. Both of these
men also benefited from the patronage of the Ptolemies and worked for part
of their lives in Alexandria—a reminder of how interconnected the
Hellenistic world was, even across political boundaries. The poet
Theocritus single-handedly invented the genre of literature that we now call
(from its Latin equivalent) ‘pastoral’. His dialogues in verse, known as
‘idylls’, were very often set in an idealised Sicilian landscape of shepherds
and pastures. The story of Daphnis, the singing shepherd who dies of
unrequited love and is lamented by all of nature, is perhaps the best known
of these.21
Archimedes of Syracuse, a friend and kinsman of the ruling dynasty, has
been described as ‘one of the greatest creative geniuses that Greek science
produced’. He is still remembered for Archimedes’s principle—a means to
determine the specific gravity, and therefore something of the chemical
composition, of an object submerged in water—as well as for the story that

he made the discovery in his bath and emerged naked to proclaim to all who
would listen, ‘Eureka!’ (‘I have found it’).22
It was during the lifetime of Archimedes, and on this western edge of the
Greek-speaking world, that a new power began to rise, one that would soon
create an empire to eclipse even Alexander’s. Indeed, the final exercise of
Archimedes’s ingenuity would cost him his life, in 212 BCE, after he had
devised anti-siege engines to keep this enemy at bay for two years
encamped outside his city. The new world power, and the enemy laying
siege to Syracuse, was Rome.23
Once upon a time, Rome was no more than another city-state on the outer
fringe of the Greek-speaking world. For hundreds of years, the borders of
the Roman state had extended no farther than Latium, the city’s immediate
hinterland in west-central Italy. Early Rome had developed as many a Greek
city-state had done before it. The Romans had expelled their last king in
509 BCE. Since then, the Latin expression that defined their state was res
publica, literally ‘the thing belonging to the people’, and the origin of the
modern term republic. By the time of Alexander’s conquests in the east, the
Roman Republic had established a nominal balance of power between the
Senate—in effect an oligarchy made up of the wealthiest citizens—and the
majority of the people. This balance was enshrined in the initials SPQR,
representing the Latin phrase ‘the Roman Senate and People’. But it was a
very unequal balance. By Greek standards, the Roman Republic was an
oligarchy, though technically it was a hybrid that included some elements of
democracy, such as the popular franchise for certain offices of state.24 Of
the Greek city-states, the one that Rome in its early years most closely
resembled was Sparta. The Roman state was highly militarised. For its
citizens, the highest goal was invariably to win honours in battle against the
state’s enemies. Eventually, this became a recipe for aggressive growth.
As the ambitions of Rome reached southwards towards the toe of Italy
and Sicily, they were bound to collide with those of Carthage, expanding in
the opposite direction. When that happened, the Greek city-states would
find themselves caught in the middle. The First Punic War (so called from
the Latin word for ‘Carthaginian’) began in 264. Until this time, Rome had
been a formidable power on land but had no navy to speak of. With great

risk, the Romans took to the seas. After a series of closely fought battles on
both sea and land, many of them in and around Sicily, the war ended in 241
BCE. The Romans won and claimed Sicily as their prize. In this way, not
just the Carthaginian cities of the island but the Greek ones too lost their
independence to Rome.
That was only the beginning. Hostilities were renewed in 218 BCE. The
Second Punic War is best remembered for the daring exploit by the
Carthaginian general Hannibal bringing an army supported by war
elephants all the way from Spain, through southern France and over the
Alpine passes through winter snow and ice, to take the Romans from the
rear and defeat them in a series of bloody battles fought in central Italy.
Rome’s survival hung by a thread. In the course of a dozen years of mutual
attrition, the Romans slowly regained the upper hand. Hannibal was forced
back to Africa and defeated in 202 BCE at the battle of Zama, fought not
far from Carthage itself.
The Greek historian Polybius, writing a little over half a century
afterwards, was the first to notice that with the outbreak of that war, history
had become what today we would call global. Up till that time, as Polybius
expresses it, events and their causes had been limited in their impact to the
part of the world where they happened. But from then on: ‘History works
like an organism; actions taking place in Italy and North Africa are
interconnected with those in Asia and Greece and the direction of all is
towards a single end.’ That end, as Polybius saw it, was the supremacy of
Rome. He wrote his history for the express purpose of making sense, for his
fellow Greeks, of how this had come about within, as he put it, the space of
‘just fifty-three years’.25
The Second Punic War again drew in the Greek cities of southern Italy
and Sicily. Several of them picked the wrong side to win—tempted by
Hannibal’s offer to ensure the ‘liberty of the Hellenes’—and as a result
shared the fate of Syracuse. From the other side of the Adriatic, the
Antigonid kingdom of Macedonia also made an alliance with Hannibal.
This had the effect of bringing the Roman legions into the southern Balkans
once the Carthaginians had been dealt with. Some of the Greek city-states
sided with the Macedonians led by Philip V, others with Rome. When Philip
was decisively defeated in Thessaly in 197 BCE, it fell to the Roman Senate

to settle the affairs of the Greek states. A commission arrived at Corinth
headed by the victorious Roman general Titus Quinctius Flamininus. If we
are to believe the word of Polybius, Flamininus persuaded the Senate that
if [the Romans] wished to gain universal renown among the Greeks, and
to convince the country as a whole that the Romans had originally
crossed the Adriatic not to advance their own interests but to secure the
liberty of the Greeks, they must withdraw from every place and set free
all the cities which were now garrisoned by Philip [V].
When this settlement was announced, at the panhellenic festival of the
Isthmian Games, held near Corinth in 196 BCE, the crowds went wild with
excitement. Flamininus was mobbed. His herald had to make the
announcement twice before he could even be heard. ‘Every factor’, wrote
Polybius, who would have been a babe in arms at the time:
combined to produce this crowning moment, when by a single
proclamation all the Greeks inhabiting both Asia and Europe became
free, with neither garrison nor tribute to burden them but enjoying their
own laws.26
Flamininus was as good at his word. The legions departed. It was now up to
the Greek city-states to manage their own affairs once again, and to keep
the peace among themselves.
But five years later, the Romans were back. This time it was the Seleucid
king Antiochus III (the Great), who had detected an opportunity to
aggrandise his kingdom and sent troops across the Hellespont, apparently in
an attempt to win over the Greek states to his own cause. This was too
much for the Senate in Rome. In a series of battles, the legions under Scipio
Africanus, the victor in the war against Carthage, pursued Antiochus back
to Anatolia. There they inflicted a final defeat at Magnesia (today’s Manisa,
not far from Izmir) in 188 BCE. It was the first time that Roman soldiers
had fought on the Asian landmass.
From that time on, Rome became increasingly confident, some would say
arrogant, in its dealings with the Greek-speaking world. The last king of
Hellenistic Macedonia was called Perseus. He seems to have harboured

ambitions to live up to his mythological namesake, who had slain the
monstrous gorgon, Medusa, and founded one of the oldest Greek dynasties.
The army mustered by this new Macedonian Perseus, in 171 BCE,
according to the Roman historian Livy, was the largest since the time of
Alexander.27 Once again, the Greek city-states took different sides, some
supporting Macedonia, others, including Athens, supporting Rome. All of
Perseus’s plans came to grief in the battle of Pydna, fought on the coast of
southern Macedonia in June 168 BCE.
A year later the former king would be paraded through the streets of
Rome among captives led in chains in the public spectacle that the Romans
reserved for such occasions and called a ‘triumph’. By that time, defeated
Macedonia had been split into four subject states, all directly answerable to
the Roman Senate. Thousands of those who had fought alongside the
Macedonians were sold into slavery. To ensure good behaviour, prominent
citizens of other Greek states were shipped off to Rome as hostages. Among
them was Polybius, who would spend the next twenty years of his life there,
writing the greater part of his History and trying to make sense of it all.
After the battle of Pydna, on the other side of the Mediterranean, the latest
in a series of ‘Syrian Wars’ between the Macedonian kings of Asia and
Egypt had just ended with the defeat of Ptolemy VI at the hands of
Antiochus IV, the son of his namesake who had lost the battle of Magnesia
to the Romans. A large portion of Alexander’s former empire was poised to
be reunited under the Seleucids and to become all-powerful. Once again,
the Roman Senate decided to take a hand. Just as Antiochus was about to
seal his victory, leading his victorious troops into Alexandria, a high-level
envoy arrived by ship from Rome.
Caius Popilius Laenas had not even brought a significant military force
with him. Instead of returning the king’s greeting, as Polybius tells it, the
Roman handed him a sealed wax tablet and told him to open it and read it
on the spot. When Antiochus complied, he found himself instructed by the
Senate to give up the war and return home empty-handed. When he tried to
prevaricate, the Roman drew a line around him in the sand with his stick
‘and told him to give his reply to the message before he stepped out of that
circle’.28 Antiochus had no choice. The episode is the origin of the phrase
we still use, ‘a line in the sand’. The ‘day of Eleusis’, as it has been known

ever since, after the suburb of Alexandria where the meeting took place,
marked a turning point. From that moment, the grateful Ptolemies and their
Egyptian kingdom would be under the protection of the most powerful state
in the world.
Rival Greek states now appealed to Rome as they had once done to Persia.
In a last-ditch effort to assert their political independence, the cities of the
Peloponnese had revived a cooperative venture that they called the
‘Common State (Koinon) of the Achaeans’. Better known as the ‘Achaean
League’, the name given to it by modern historians, the attempt has been
hailed as ‘one of the great constitutional innovations of the Hellenistic
world’ and has even been credited with inspiring the federal Constitution of
the United States.29 The historian Polybius was also a fan, as his father had
been one of the leading lights in its formation. But if the Achaean League
represented a real constitutional breakthrough by the Greeks, it was too
little and it came too late. The trouble with this latest attempt at
confederation was the same as it had always been. How much autonomy
could be allowed to individual members? What forms of coercion did it
take to get them to work together? Sparta, in particular, had never wanted to
be part of any federal state and violently resisted being dragged into this
one. Others followed the Spartan lead. And so, as the year 146 BCE
approached, the Romans had all the excuse they needed to intervene once
more.
The timing was the worst possible for the Greeks. Quite why Roman
policy should have taken such a savage turn that year was already a puzzle
in the ancient world and remains so today.30 But it seems that drawing lines
in the sand was no longer enough for the senators. Even the humbling of
Carthage at the end of the Second Punic War had not been decisive enough.
Nothing less than total destruction would do. And so, without much regard
for pretexts, a Third Punic War followed in 149 BCE. Three years later,
Carthage was razed to the ground.
At almost the same time, during the summer of 146 BCE, an army fielded
by the Achaean League was defeated outside Corinth by the Roman consul
Lucius Mummius. The Greek city was singled out for the same treatment.
Many of its people had already fled. Of those who remained, most of the
men were killed, the women and children sold into slavery. Public buildings

were torn down and set on fire. Art treasures were pillaged and shipped off
to Rome. By order of the Senate, no one was allowed to return to the ruins
or ever live there again. A hundred years would pass before the decree
would be rescinded and Corinth would begin to rise once more, this time as
a colony for settlers from Italy. In the meantime, at Corinth just as at
Carthage, the wrecked houses and temples would be left as an empty
wilderness—and a terrible warning to any other would-be enemies of
Rome.31
Rome was not yet the capital of an empire, ruled by an emperor. That still
lay more than a century in the future. But all the time that the Roman
Senate and Roman legions were wresting political influence and military
power away from the Greek-speaking world and into their own hands, the
future Roman civilisation was being formed. The process of ‘becoming
Greek’ could work just as well through being conquered as through
conquering others.
Most Greeks had not taken a great deal of notice of Rome until they had
been forced to by events. Romans, on the other hand, had always been
aware of the stories and the art of the Greeks. Even before the foundation of
Rome itself, as we know from archaeology, large numbers of Greek painted
pots had found their way onto tables and into graves throughout western
Italy. Romans spoke a different language, of course—Latin—though it still
belongs to the same Indo-European family of languages (unlike Etruscan,
the language of their neighbours). The gods they worshipped had different
names. But Jupiter, his wife Juno, and the rest of the quarrelsome tribe of
gods and goddesses worshipped in Rome bore strong family resemblances
to Zeus, Hera, and the Greek gods of Olympus. According to a story that
had been current since at least the fifth century BCE, the ultimate ancestor
of the Romans was Aeneas, a hero from the Iliad, who had led the remnant
of the defeated Trojans to make a new home in Italy. Through the myths
about their gods and the legends of their heroes, the Romans from an early
stage had been inserting themselves into older narratives that already
existed in Greek.32
But it was during the third and second centuries BCE, at exactly the time
when the Roman state was bursting out of its central Italian heartland and
making conquests abroad, that Romans most obviously went out of their

way to emulate the culture of this one group among the many peoples they
conquered. Roman writers began to compose history, epic poetry, and
tragedies, not only in the Greek manner but also very often actually in
Greek. Theatre came to Rome in the year 240 BCE. During the next
century, the Latin comedies of Plautus and Terence, based closely on the
plot devices and stock characters of Athenian New Comedy, would
establish a tradition that would last for centuries. And while Latin
established itself as what a later age would call a ‘language of culture’,
most of those who made up the Roman elite were thoroughly bilingual in
Latin and Greek.33
Writing in Latin not long after the Second Punic War, a Roman author
commented that it was the very violence of Rome’s conquests abroad that
had brought the Muses, those divine patrons of the arts according to Greek
mythology, to impose themselves ‘on the fierce inhabitants of Rome’. And
a century and a half after the destruction of Corinth by Lucius Mummius,
one of the greatest of all Roman poets, Quintus Horatius Flaccus, better
known as Horace, would famously acknowledge: ‘Captive Greece took
captive her fierce conqueror, and introduced her arts into rude Latium.’34
Farther east, in places still beyond the reach of Rome, a double process
was going on. On the one hand, the once-vast Seleucid kingdom of Asia
was being steadily whittled away. On the other, all round the edges of what
remained, new independent states were springing up, but still modelling
themselves on the Hellenistic kingdoms and their Greek ways.
Beyond the Tigris, a nomadic people, the Parthians, annexed the Iranian
heartland of the old Persian Empire and in time would become the principal
rival in the region, first to the Seleucids and then to Rome. But Parthian
rulers minted coins in the Greek style. They had their names inscribed on
them in Greek, along with the Greek title basileus (king), and sometimes
for good measure, ‘philhellene’ (literally, ‘Greek-loving’). A Parthian
palace on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, a place never reached even
by Alexander, was designed in the Greek manner, with statues that imitated
classical Greek originals.35 On the other side of their kingdom, the
Seleucids were losing their grip over Anatolia to breakaway rivals. In the
northwest, the city of Pergamum, not far from the Aegean coast opposite

Lesbos, became the capital of a newly independent kingdom. The rulers of
Pergamum, the Attalids, were Macedonians and the region had been Greekspeaking for centuries. But farther east along the Black Sea coast of
Anatolia, Bithynia was now ruled by Thracians, the non-Greek-speaking
people from the European side of the Dardanelles; Pontus, by a Persian
family whose name in Greek became Mithridates. Inland and to the south,
another Persian family set up a dynasty in Cappadocia, yet another in the
tiny enclave of Commagene on the borders of today’s Turkey and Syria.
Some of these dynasties intermarried with the Seleucids. But in origin
none of them, other than the Attalids of Pergamum, was Greek-speaking.
Greek would have been a foreign tongue to most of their subjects. And yet,
in all these places, the Greek language and the trappings of the Hellenistic
kingdoms were seized upon by rulers and filtered through to their people.
The elites of these non-Greek kingdoms seem to have vied with one another
to show how ‘Greek-loving’ they could be—not in terms of political
alignment, but culturally. And a common language that could be used
across great distances must have had a practical appeal, too, particularly in
Anatolia where none had existed before. ‘Becoming Greek’, quite simply,
was the fashion everywhere during the second century BCE.
Only in one place, and by one group of people, was the trend seriously
resisted. And even there, resistance had its limits. The exception that proves
the general rule is the story of the Jews. Before the coming of the
Macedonians, the people of the former kingdoms of Israel and Judaea had
for several centuries maintained a form of ‘extreme ethnic separatism’. Key
to this was their worship of a sole god who was not only the creator and
‘saviour’ of this one people but also the only god who had existed or could
ever exist anywhere. Among peoples who worshipped many gods, it could
be an easy matter to recognise equivalences, as had happened with the
Roman Jupiter and the Greek Zeus. There are many such examples
throughout antiquity. But the Jewish belief in a single god, or monotheism,
explicitly forbade the worship of any other.36 The trade-offs that allowed
the polytheistic religions of the ancient world to rub along together were not
possible in the case of a different type of religion altogether.
While their lands had formed part of the Persian Empire, the Jews had
been ruled by the high priest of the Temple at Jerusalem, the chief city of

Judaea, without much interference. At first, the same arrangement
continued after Alexander’s conquest. But in 301 BCE, at a crucial moment
during the wars of succession, according to later Jewish sources, Ptolemy I
sacked Jerusalem and took thousands of Jews from Judaea back with him to
Egypt as prisoners of war. For the next hundred years, most of what was
then called Syria remained under the control of the Ptolemies of Egypt, not
the Seleucids of Asia. In Egypt, the captives were given their freedom and
encouraged to settle. This marked the beginning of the Jewish community
of Alexandria. Before long, other Jews came of their own accord to join
those already there. Just as Egypt under the Ptolemies proved a magnet to
Greeks from elsewhere, so it seems to have been for Jews. By the middle of
the third century BCE, substantial Jewish communities existed in Ptolemaic
Egypt as well as in their traditional homeland.37
Back in Jerusalem, after the upheaval caused by the first Ptolemy, the high
priests seem to have been left once more to rule over their people in the
traditional way for a century. Then in 200 BCE, Antiochus III ousted the
Ptolemies from Syria and took over. At first it seemed as though little
would change. The new ruler reconfirmed the rights and privileges of the
high priests. The separate laws and customs of the Jewish religion were
once more to be protected. Nonetheless, whatever had been the practice
before, it seems that now candidates for the high priesthood would be
expected to pay for the privilege.
In 175 BCE, on the accession of Antiochus IV, the brother of the reigning
high priest outbid the incumbent and obtained royal patronage to depose
him. The usurper was probably named Joshua but seems to have chosen to
be known by the Greek name of Jason. Jason’s first act was to establish a
gymnasium in Jerusalem. This was a traditional Greek complex of indoor
and outdoor spaces combining something of the modern gym, gentlemen’s
club, and sixth-form college. Another innovation was an ephebeion: a cadet
corps for young men. Both of these were modelled on institutions that had
long been established in Athens and other Greek cities. We know nothing of
Jason’s motives, because we have only the word of his opponents. Currying
favour with the patron to whom he owed his position no doubt played a
part. But he may also have aspired to bring his people into line with a
fashion that was sweeping the world around them.

For seven years, under Jason as high priest, the traditional Jewish rituals
of the Temple seem to have coexisted with these innovations. Young men
enrolled at the gymnasium and volunteered for the cadet corps. Jewish
athletes were to be seen exercising wearing wide-brimmed sunhats called
petasoi. In Athens and other Greek cities, of course, athletes wore nothing
at all. The petasos was a Macedonian addition. Whether the young men of
Jerusalem wore anything else when they exercised we are not told by the
anonymous Jewish historian who wrote up these events, in Greek, some
decades afterwards. But the author was not shy of expressing his opinions.
The sense of outrage to Jewish sensibilities comes through loud and clear.
As the writer sums it up, ‘It was prime-time for “becoming Greek”
(hellenismos) and for the rise of adopting alien customs (allophylismos)’,
both terms used for the first time in Greek, so far as we know. All this was
due to the ‘overweening and abominable wickedness’ of the ‘impious
Jason,’ who, behaving ‘quite unlike a High Priest’, had set about
‘transforming the people of his own race to [conform to] the Hellenic
character’.38
The last of the Syrian Wars, that ended in 168 BCE with Antiochus IV
trapped by the line in the sand drawn by the Roman envoy Popilius Laenas,
had shocking consequences for Jerusalem. Exactly what happened, and in
what sequence, has been much debated. Jason lost office when an even
higher bidder went over his head to Antiochus. The deposed Jason then led
a rebellion against the new high priest, who had also adopted a name out of
Greek mythology: Menelaus. Fighting broke out in Jerusalem between
supporters of Jason and supporters of Menelaus. It may have been on the
way to his humiliation in the Alexandrian suburb of Eleusis or on the way
back that Antiochus diverted, with his army, to Jerusalem to quell the
violence there. If the intention had been to restore order, the effect was to
prove the exact opposite. Whether or not they were acting on orders, the
royal troops ransacked the city and desecrated the Temple. To compound
matters, shortly afterwards, Antiochus issued an edict which has no known
parallel in the whole Hellenistic world but which chillingly prefigures any
number of stories of religious persecution in much later times.
Thanks to a second Jewish chronicler, again anonymous, whose words
would later be translated into Greek, we can read this summary of the edict:

‘The whole of his kingdom… should all form one people and they should
each give up their own customs.’ Not content with that, according to the
same chronicler, Antiochus went on to build an ‘abomination of desolation’
on Temple Mount. By this was probably meant an altar dedicated to the
Syrian god Baal. The writer does not say that Jews were compelled to
worship at it. But the sacrilege in such a place was obvious. And it does
appear that throughout the Jewish provinces sacrifices to pagan gods
became compulsory. Some Jews even considered them a price worth paying
in return for peace and royal favour.39
All this was the very opposite of what Alexander, or any of his successors,
had done in the lands he had conquered. What could account for such a
departure? No doubt Antiochus was still smarting from his humiliation by
the Romans. The instinct of the bully, in such circumstances, to turn on an
inferior might have been part of it. But there could have been a subtler
calculation, too. What could be the secret of Roman power, Antiochus may
have been asking himself, that his own still-powerful kingdom lacked? If
Seleucid Asia were ever to stand up against a unified and homogeneous
‘Roman Senate and People’, maybe there would be no better place to start
homogenising than with this recalcitrant group of subjects in Jerusalem?
In Judaea, the effect was incendiary. A revolt was led by a family known
to history as the Hasmoneans, and also by the nickname of ‘Maccabees’ or
‘Maccabaeans’ (from the Hebrew word for ‘hammer’). Antiochus himself
died on campaign far to the east in 164 BCE, just when the revolt led by
Judas Maccabaeus had succeeded in defeating the Seleucid garrison in
Jerusalem and restoring the Temple. This is the event still celebrated in the
Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Shortly afterwards, a decree issued in the
name of the new king, Antiochus V, revoked the earlier one.40 The
persecution was over—though it could be said that its long-term effects are
still with us, more than two thousand years later.
The consequences of these actions would prove very different from
anything that could have been intended by Antiochus IV. In 140 BCE,
another of the Maccabees would take the Greek title of king (basileus),
effectively making Judaea independent. Over the next eighty years, under
the Hasmonean dynasty, the boundaries of the Jewish kingdom would
expand to include all the geographical area of Palestine west of the River

Jordan, reaching to the Mediterranean coast. The revolt of the Maccabees
had been directed not only against the political power of a Hellenistic
kingdom but also against the cultural penetration of Greek ideas and Greek
ways of doing things. It was probably the only time, in the whole history of
the period, when this happened.
But even here, the rejection of ‘becoming Greek’ would only ever go so
far. The Hasmoneans, like every other breakaway dynasty in the east,
whether originally Greek-speaking or not, ran their kingdom along
Hellenistic lines. Their rulers adopted Greek names along with Jewish ones.
Their coins were inscribed in three languages: Greek, Hebrew, and
Aramaic. And for the next three hundred years, the history of these and
subsequent struggles of the Jewish people for self-determination would be
written and disseminated in Greek. Indeed, it is only through the surviving
Greek sources that we know about them at all.41
The way the story has been told ever since, the period of a little over a
century after the destruction of Carthage and Corinth in 146 BCE saw the
most rapid and continuous expansion of Roman power that would
culminate in the establishment of Rome as an ‘empire without limit’.42 But
for anyone alive during those years, and particularly in the Greek-speaking
east, it cannot have seemed like that. While the Hellenistic dynasties were
collapsing into internecine warfare, and breakaway kingdoms fought
against one another, Rome was just one of many players in a crowded and
bewildering field. Not even the Romans could be relied on to win all their
battles. And even when the legions did carry the day abroad, at times the
Roman res publica itself seemed on the verge of internal collapse. The
abrupt rise from city-state to world power during the previous century had
hollowed out the venerable institutions of the Republic. Over a sixty-year
period, from 91 BCE to 31 BCE, at the same time as fighting external
enemies, Rome was frequently at war with itself.
It began with a vicious war in Italy. By 91 BCE, the whole of the Italian
peninsula was subject to laws made in Rome. But only citizens of the
citizen-state could vote or have any say in the making of these laws. The
misleadingly named ‘Social War’, that broke out in that year, was fought
between the city of Rome and its ‘allies’ (socii in Latin) in the rest of the

Italian peninsula over their respective rights. The original aim of the allies
may have been to break away and regain their independence. Most of those
in the south, after all, had originally been Greek-speaking city-states; plenty
still were and kept up their cultural and economic links with the rest of the
Greek world. Their citizens may still have been susceptible to the lure of
the ‘liberty of the Hellenes’. If that had been the aim, the outcome was the
exact opposite. The Senate, threatened with losing the war, granted Roman
citizenship and some of its traditional rights to almost all the inhabitants of
Italy in 88 BCE. There would be no more talk of breaking away. And at the
very time when the Roman elite was still becoming Greek culturally, the
mass of the Greek-speaking population of southern Italy overnight became
Romans legally. A precedent had been set.
Of greater concern to most Greeks than upheavals in Italy was the war
that dragged on for almost half a century between Rome and Mithridates
VI, the part-Greek, part-Persian strongman ruler of Pontus. During its
heyday in the early first century BCE, this kingdom had expanded from its
base in northern Anatolia to draw in the Greek settlements all the way
round the Black Sea, and then to dominate the entire Anatolian
subcontinent. In a single year, 89 BCE, Mithridates defeated Roman armies
no fewer than four times. The following spring, he instituted a new kind of
warfare that would reverberate down the centuries.
Secret orders sent to every Greek city in Anatolia orchestrated a massacre
of ‘Romans and Italians, together with their wives and children and freed
slaves, everyone of Italian descent’. Modern historians draw the obvious
parallels with genocide and ‘ethnic cleansing’. Somewhere between eighty
thousand and one hundred and fifty thousand people were killed on a single
day throughout Anatolia. Horrific as it is, this story also highlights how
many civilians must already have followed in the path of the Roman legions
to make a home and livelihood for themselves in these eastern possessions,
that had now fallen under the sway of Mithridates. Some will have been
officials, such as tax gatherers, others former soldiers who had been granted
land in return for service, others again engaged in business and trade. Those
who carried out the order, concluded a Greek historian writing almost two
centuries later, can have been motivated only in part by fear of Mithridates.

They must also have ‘hated the Romans enough to behave towards them in
this way’.43
Many Greeks who followed these events from across the Aegean shared
the same balance of sentiments. For all the savagery of his methods, might
Mithridates be the best prospect, in the new circumstances, for the stillcherished ‘liberty of the Hellenes’? Some thought it was worth taking a
chance. Even Athens, which had traditionally been careful to cultivate close
ties with Rome, switched sides. Retribution was swift and deadly. Now it
was the turn of Athens to suffer as Thebes and Corinth had done in previous
conflicts. The Roman general Sulla laid siege to the city and its port,
Piraeus. The siege lasted until the spring of 86 BCE. By this time, some of
the citizens had been reduced to cannibalism. When Sulla’s forces broke in,
there was a great and pitiless massacre: for the inhabitants were unable
to escape because they were starving, neither was there any pity shown
to children or women. Sulla ordered the killing of anyone who was
found.
Archaeology cannot confirm the sufferings of the defenders. But clear signs
of the devastation done to buildings came to light during twentieth-century
excavations in the Athenian Agora.44
It would take another twenty years after this for the Romans to defeat
Mithridates. In the meantime, in a sure sign of a growing power vacuum in
the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean, maritime communities were
putting to sea and taking the law into their own hands, seizing goods and
slaves on their own account. In 69 BCE, a raid on the island of Delos all but
obliterated this thriving, multicultural, polyglot centre of the international
slave trade. The perpetrators are invariably called ‘pirates’ in the ancient
sources. But modern historians suspect that behind these upheavals must
have lain deeper causes, rooted in widespread disaffection and the decay of
law and order during a time when Macedonian power was collapsing and it
was not yet clear whether Rome would prove strong enough to replace it.45
It was not until the 60s BCE that Rome convincingly began to regain the
upper hand in the Greek-speaking east. Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (the
Great), better known in English as Pompey, was sent into the Aegean by
order of the Senate in 67 BCE with five hundred ships and over a hundred

thousand troops. Not only did he destroy the pirates’ bases, Pompey went
on to roll up what little was left of the Seleucid kingdom of Asia three years
later, and the Hasmonean kingdom of Judaea a year after that in 63 BCE.
When Pompey returned to Rome to celebrate his ‘triumph’ in 61 BCE, it
must have seemed as though he had brought the Greek-speaking east back
with him. Thousands of captives from almost every part of the empire that
had once been conquered by Alexander were paraded behind Pompey’s
chariot through the streets of the city. The victor himself wore a shirt which
he claimed had once belonged to Alexander. The title ‘Magnus’, that he had
granted himself some years earlier, further placed the victorious Roman
general in the shoes of the Macedonian conqueror. Statues of Pompey that
still survive show him with the quiff or forelock that had long been the
trademark of Alexander’s public image.
A more lasting testimony to the same effect was the complex of buildings
that Pompey commissioned at the same time in the centre of Rome.
Pompey’s Theatre opened its doors in 55 BCE. It was quite possibly the
largest permanent theatre ever built on the standard Greek pattern. Its
capacity is said to have reached forty thousand. And the complex housed
more than the traditional semicircular auditorium. Anterooms and side halls
accommodated a dazzling range of exhibits mostly trawled from the east.
So opulent and capacious were the buildings that when the Senate House
burned down in a riot shortly afterwards, the Senate took to meeting in one
of the theatre’s halls. The unmistakable trappings of Hellenistic kingship
were coming to Rome.46
Rome now ruled the southern Balkans up to the River Danube, the whole
of Anatolia and the Aegean, and in the east had become embattled against
the Parthians for the spoils of what had once been the Seleucid kingdom of
Asia. In the west, Roman power had spread even farther, and even faster, to
take in Spain and Gaul (all of France, plus parts of Switzerland and
Germany up to the Rhine). The conquest of Gaul and the first, brief landing
by Roman legionaries on the coast of Britain had been the work of
Pompey’s younger rival, Gaius Julius Caesar. Military leaders who could
command the loyalty of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and leave their
mark on the urban landscape of Rome itself were carving up the world

among them, while the traditional institutions of the Roman Republic were
visibly struggling to contain their ambitions.
Civil war broke out in 49 BCE. From then on, the battles of Romans
against Romans would all be fought in the Greek-speaking east. The last
survivor of the great Hellenistic kingdoms, Egypt, found itself caught
fatefully in the middle. For more than a century, the Ptolemies had relied on
Rome for the external protection of their kingdom. Latterly, different
branches of this incestuously ramified family had been at one another’s
throats, and Rome had become the arbitrator in these quarrels, too. Ptolemy
XII Auletes (‘the Oboe Player’) had held his throne thanks to the patronage
of Rome until his death in 51 BCE. Pompey had taken good care to nurture
this relationship while he had been in the east. So when Caesar routed his
army at the battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly in 48 BCE, it was to Alexandria
that Pompey fled.47
Egypt was now ruled by the most famous of all the Ptolemies. This was
the Oboe Player’s daughter, Cleopatra VII. But the young queen was locked
in a deadly struggle against her brother, Ptolemy XIII. The kingdom was in
chaos. One faction murdered Pompey on his arrival in hopes of currying
favour with Caesar. Caesar chose, instead, to back Cleopatra and secured
her position on the throne, while her youngest brother, aged only twelve,
became nominally the fourteenth Ptolemy—until he disappears from the
record, presumed murdered, a few years later. Shortly after Caesar left
Egypt, Cleopatra gave birth to a son, who would be nicknamed ‘Caesarion’
or ‘little Caesar’ because he was reputed to be Caesar’s son.
Then came the murder of Caesar, while the Senate was meeting in a hall
in Pompey’s Theatre, on the Ides of March 44 BCE. The murder and its
sequel make up one of the best-known stories of the ancient world, thanks
in large part to the two plays that Shakespeare based closely on the
biographies of the protagonists written in Greek by Plutarch a little over a
century after the events: Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra. Violence
once more tore through Rome and the Roman world of the east. It took two
years before the armies of Brutus and Cassius, the principal conspirators in
the murder, were defeated outside Philippi, the city in Macedonia that owed
its name to Philip II. The victorious legions on that occasion were led by
Mark Antony, a former supporter of Caesar who had whipped up the

Roman crowd to a frenzy at his funeral, together with a distant relative of
Caesar who had been only nineteen years old at the time, by the name of
Gaius Octavius.
A decade later, a new power struggle broke out between these two. By the
time battle was joined, in 31 BCE, Antony had made common cause (and a
bigamous marriage) with Cleopatra of Egypt. Each side had a powerful
claim to Caesar’s legacy. Cleopatra ruled jointly (at least in name) with
Ptolemy XV, who was none other than Caesarion, her teenage son whose
father was generally supposed to have been Caesar. But the former Gaius
Octavius could go one better. Caesar, in his will, had adopted him as his
only legitimate son and heir, in the process changing his name to Octavian
and adding to it the family name of Caesar. Cleopatra’s son had (in all
probability) much the closer relationship by blood. But in those days there
was no way of proving it. Legitimacy counted for much in ancient Rome.
The decisive battle, this time, was fought at sea. But the nearest land was
once again Greece: the cape on the west coast, near the modern town of
Preveza, by the name of Actium. The outcome could have gone either way.
If Antony and Cleopatra had won, Plutarch’s account of a pageant held in
Alexandria not long before gives a tantalising glimpse of what might have
been. In sumptuous surroundings, the couple’s three infant children and
Caesarion were paraded before the people. Each was assigned a set of
kingdoms in the east. Antony’s twin sons by Cleopatra were proclaimed
‘kings of kings’.
The scene would be reimagined almost two thousand years later by the
Greek poet C. P. Cavafy, writing in the same city, Alexandria. With
characteristic wistful irony, Cavafy suggests that the Alexandrians present
‘knew of course that this was words and play-acting’. But the day was
warm and the sun was shining, so they went along with the spectacle, even
though ‘they knew what these things were worth, what empty words these
kingdoms were’.48 Shorn of the hindsight enjoyed by a Plutarch or a
Cavafy, this was simply Hellenistic kingship on show, in all its fantastical
glory. There would have been a role for Rome, too, surely, as the greatest
kingdom of all. In the event, it was Octavian’s side that won at Actium. But
the outcome, in the long run, minus the fantasy and dressed in a more brutal
sort of glory, was perhaps not so very different.

Antony and Cleopatra fled back to Alexandria, where both committed
suicide in the summer of 30 BCE. Caesarion, or Ptolemy XV, aged just
seventeen, ruled alone for only a few weeks before being executed on the
orders of Octavian. The Hellenistic kingdom of the Ptolemies was no more.
Egypt became a Roman province at once. ‘Achaea’, meaning most of
today’s Greece, followed in 27 BCE. In the same year, Octavian proclaimed
himself sole ruler in Rome. The mantle of Alexander, coveted by so many,
had finally fallen on the shoulders of this man, who at the age of thirty-six
took for himself yet another name: Augustus, or ‘Revered One’. What we
now know as the Roman Empire had begun.49

7
ROME’S GREEK EMPIRE
27 BCE–337 CE

P

eace had been imposed on the entire Greek-speaking world by force of

arms. Others before Augustus had tried, but the peace had never lasted. This
time it did. Indeed, throughout the greater part of that world, it would last
for a good two hundred years. The period is still summed up, even today, by
the Latin phrases pax romana (Roman peace) or pax Augusta. Greeks had
never experienced anything like it.
With peace went a political stability that was also without parallel in
earlier Greek history. This was the underlying reality behind the stories of
the lurid lives, sordid deaths, and intrigues of the first dynasty of emperors
to succeed Augustus in Rome. These and many other such stories first went
into public circulation towards the end of the first century CE and have lost
nothing of their power to horrify or titillate ever since. Tiberius died a
paranoid recluse in his seventies in 37 CE after instituting a reign of terror
among the highest levels of the Roman elite; his successor, Caligula,
probably did not, in reality, appoint his horse as consul but would still be
murdered by his own guards in broad daylight in the centre of Rome. And
the infamous Nero, the last in line, we will meet again.
But it has been argued that for most of the empire’s subjects, during those
two hundred years, the personality and private vices of the reigning
emperor made little difference to their lives. The system of government laid
down by Augustus during his forty-year reign would prove both stable and
durable.1 And although the right of a particular emperor to rule would
frequently be contested in times to come, for as long as the empire lasted no

one would ever challenge the imperial system itself—an extraordinary
contrast to the constant political experimentation and turmoil of the old
Greek city-states.

7. The Roman Empire in the late third century CE

3307

By the time Augustus died in 14 CE, the Roman Empire stretched from
the Atlantic coasts of Portugal, Spain, and France in the west to the
Euphrates in the east and Aswan in southern Egypt. It included all the
islands in the Mediterranean and nearly all the coastline of what Romans
were already calling mare nostrum (our sea). Around the eastern fringes of
this empire, some smaller kingdoms that had broken away from the
Seleucids maintained a notional independence for a little longer. Within a
few decades they, too, would be fully absorbed. The Roman Empire would
reach its largest extent a hundred years after the time of Augustus, in the
reigns of the emperors Trajan and Hadrian. All the lands between the
Euphrates and the Mediterranean, where the process of ‘becoming Greek’
had been going on ever since the time of Alexander, would once again be
brought together into a single political entity.2
Everywhere, the language of imperial administration and in the highest
courts of law was Latin. But throughout the eastern provinces, Greek had
either been spoken as a first language for centuries or had long ago been
adopted as the normal written medium for business, education, and local
administration. Roman officials, no doubt for pragmatic reasons, accepted
the situation as they found it. There was never any kind of formal
recognition that the eastern half of the empire actually functioned in a
different language from the official one. But much of the later history of
Europe would be founded on an informal division that seems to have
become tacitly accepted during or shortly after the time of Augustus—
between a Latin-speaking west and a Greek-speaking east.
Nobody ever thought to draw this linguistic division on a map. Allowing
for a few exceptional enclaves on either side, it follows a straight line
drawn from north to south through the strait that separates the toe of Italy
from the island of Corfu. In modern terms, Austria (up to the Danube
frontier), Croatia, and parts of the western Balkans belonged to the Latin
side, as did the North African coast from Tunisia westwards. To the east of
that line, and south of the River Danube, the everyday form of Greek
known as Koine continued to be the common language of speech and of
most written records below the highest levels of the imperial
administration.3

This line of division marks a subtle but important change to the shape of
the Greek-speaking world. Long-established Greek settlements in Sicily,
southern Italy, southern France, and the Mediterranean coast of Spain were
assimilated. Romans still used the geographical term Magna Graecia (Great
Greece) to describe the southern half of their own landmass, Italy. But they
did so in Latin. Some memories of the language, customs, and the earlier
history of these former Greek settlements would persist until at least the end
of the second century CE, possibly for even longer. But despite these
occasional survivals, effectively, ‘Great Greece’ had been absorbed into the
Latin-dominated west by the time of Augustus. The dispersed Greekspeaking world of ‘ants or frogs around a pond’ had become consolidated,
in a way never seen before, upon the islands and continental hinterlands of
the eastern Mediterranean.4
Throughout the Greek east, the largest cities prospered and became even
larger. The paved streets, long colonnades, elaborate fountains and
bathhouses (relying on water brought by Roman engineering) of Gerasa
(Jerash) and Gadara (Um Qais) in Jordan or Ephesus and Aphrodisias in
Turkey can still be seen and admired by visitors today. Farther west, Crete,
now the capital of a province that extended to include Cyrenaica in North
Africa, prospered under a central administration as it had never done since
Minoan times. On the Greek mainland, Corinth had been reestablished as a
Roman colonia for settlers from Italy, after lying desolate for a century. The
revived city was flourishing. So was Nicopolis (‘Victory City’ in Greek).
This was originally another colonial project, built on the orders of Augustus
on the coast of Epiros, close to today’s town of Preveza, to commemorate
his victory over Antony and Cleopatra in the sea battle of Actium not far
offshore. But by the second century CE, the distinction between Roman
‘colonies’ and Greek cities established earlier had been all but forgotten.
The process of assimilation, that in Sicily and southern Italy had seen Greek
replaced by Latin, here worked in the opposite direction. The descendants
of Italian settlers in the east now spoke and wrote in Greek.5
Roman rule lay lightly on these cities. The empire had been built on the
formidable power of armies controlled from the centre. But in peacetime it
was maintained by the absolute minimum of bureaucracy possible. Very
much as the Persians had used to do, and as Alexander had done in the

wake of his conquests, the Romans relied on the elites of the cities and
regions they had conquered to do the business of ruling for them. The
wealthier citizens of a traditional Greek polis could be relied on for their
loyalty because Roman rule protected their interests and guaranteed their
status within their communities. Increasingly, as time went on, more and
more members of these elites would be rewarded with the gift of Roman
citizenship. With it came privileges and rights not granted to the majority of
the empire’s subjects.6
Under these arrangements, many of the trappings of Greek civic
governance continued long into the period of Roman rule. Larger cities still
minted their own coins, even if currency values and the alloys used were
standardised across the empire. Local officials could still be elected. City
councils still operated and took decisions at the level of the municipality,
even if the criterion for office was now wealth. Wealthy citizens vied with
one another more than ever for the honour of hosting (and paying for)
grandiose public works, festivals, and games. Their reward would be the
privilege of seeing their likeness publicly displayed in a statue of stone or
bronze. Ever afterwards, passers-by would be able to read inscribed upon
the base on which the statue stood an account of how generous the donor
had been. Increasingly, wealth was becoming concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. All these trends can be traced back to the period of the
Macedonian conquests—that is to say, to the very beginning of the age of
‘becoming Greek’. Under Rome, they only intensified. On these grounds, it
has been argued, we can rightfully speak of a ‘long Hellenistic age’ that
began with the campaigns of Alexander in the east and lasted well into the
second century CE.7
Greek speakers had probably never at any time in their previous history
been so numerous, so prosperous, or lived such comfortable lives as they
did now. And throughout the eastern empire they continued to do what they
had always done best, which was to talk and write in their own language.
Writers in every genre that had so far been devised put pen to papyrus. They
also invented new ones: biography, the novel, satirical sketches. Philosophy
continued to flourish, particularly in Athens and Alexandria. Historians still
did their best to understand and interpret the past—particularly, and with an
evident nostalgia, the achievements of Alexander the Great. The writers of

this period have never won the level of admiration that they themselves
heaped upon their long-dead predecessors of the classical period. But far
more of what they wrote has survived. Much of what we know about earlier
centuries has come to us filtered through the perceptions of Greeks who
lived and wrote under the rule of Rome.
In other branches of knowledge, writers in Greek during the same two
centuries have been credited with achieving the ‘culmination of ancient
science’. Ptolemy of Alexandria, during the first half of the second century
CE, studied the movements of the stars and planets. His treatise on
astronomy, written in about 150 and known by the name of its translation
into Arabic, Almagest, would represent the furthest extent of human
knowledge on the subject until the discoveries of Copernicus in the early
fifteenth century. A generation after Ptolemy, Galen of Pergamum was a
practising surgeon and anatomist. His surviving medical writings fill
twenty-one substantial volumes in the standard modern edition, much the
largest output of any ancient writer in Greek. And that is believed to be only
about a third of all that he wrote. Volume, of course, is not everything, in
either literature or science. But Galen’s understanding of the anatomical
structure of humans and animals and his experimental method would set the
benchmark for medical knowledge until modern times.8
All these were the dividends of peace. But they came at a price. Greek
speakers no longer held their destinies in their own hands, except at the
most local level of city government. Plutarch, writing towards the end of
the first century CE, put into words what many must have thought.
Advising a young man who was thinking of running for office in his city,
Plutarch warned him that he would face responsibilities once borne by the
great Pericles. But you should never forget, either, he goes on, that ‘you
who rule are also ruled over by others; you rule in a city subjected to
[Roman] proconsuls, the functionaries of the emperor.’ You must not take
your authority too seriously, ‘since you can see the calcei above your head’.
(Calceus is the Latin word for ‘shoe’, the foreign word tactfully injected to
suggest something more like the hobnailed boot of the Roman soldier.)
Better, for that reason, says Plutarch, to behave like an actor and keep

within the limits of your allotted role. In the present ‘weakened condition of
Greek affairs’, the advice continues:
the best course for those who think wisely is to enjoy a life of peace and
harmony, since fortune has left to them no prize worth striving for. For
what authority do you have… or what power, when a minor edict from a
proconsul can dissolve it at a stroke or hand it over to someone else?
Even if it should last, what is the point of it?9
The answer that Plutarch and dozens of others like him gave, spread over
thousands of pages written during the first centuries of the Roman Empire,
was an oblique one. More often than not, they would avoid even
mentioning the existence of the political system under which they all lived,
still less the compromises that living in it required. Plutarch, in all that he
wrote, under his Greek name as a citizen of Chaeronea in Boeotia and
latterly as a priest of Apollo at Delphi, chose never to mention that at some
point in his life he had acquired another public identity, as the Roman
citizen Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus.10 Plutarch was proud enough of that
second identity to see it inscribed on the base of a statue of the emperor
Hadrian erected at Delphi. But it had no place in his work as a Greek writer.
To have alluded to it would have been a lapse of taste, or what today we
might term a ‘category error’.
A far more congenial topic was the glory days of the past. Within a couple
of generations of the death of Augustus, all over the Greek-speaking east a
network of private educators had established a curriculum that inculcated a
knowledge of ancient Greek history and culture. For this informal,
unofficial system to flourish as it did, there must have been demand for
what it offered. At the highest level, students learned to write elaborate
speeches in the manner of Isocrates and Demosthenes, who had lived in the
heyday of Athenian democracy. Those who graduated as professional
speech makers went on to tour the provinces and even gave command
performances in Rome itself. They became known as ‘sophists’, after the
itinerant philosophers who had made a name for themselves in the fifth
century BCE. But these new sophists were celebrated, not for their ideas but
for their words. The days when an Alcibiades or a Demosthenes would
address the Athenian Assembly and the lives of thousands would depend on

whether the motion was carried or not were long gone, and everybody knew
it. This was speech making as an art form, even a medium of entertainment.
It was not enough for the members of this new educated elite to write
about a better past. They even made a virtue of trying to imitate the very
language and style of their great predecessors. This meant turning back the
clock on the many changes that had been quietly happening in everyday
speech since the conquering Macedonians had adopted a form of the
Athenian dialect as their own official language. ‘Common Greek’, or Koine,
had evolved a good deal in the four centuries that had gone by since then.
But sophists vied with one another to re-create the dialect of Athens, known
as Attic, as it had been in the time of the orators they most revered. The
craze lasted for a full two hundred years, from the middle of the first
century CE to about 250. Around that time, the descriptive label, the
‘Second Sophistic’, began to appear and the name has stuck ever since.11
Fascination with the Greek culture, history, and language of times long
gone reached right to the very top of the Roman Empire. Augustus, even
before he became emperor, had paid homage to the tomb of Alexander in
Alexandria, as his adoptive father, Julius Caesar, had done before him. The
victories that had brought supreme power to Augustus had all been won in
the Greek east. During his reign as emperor, he went on to take a personal
interest not so much in the Greek-speaking regions of his empire as in the
historical heartland of what Romans began to term ‘true’ Greece (Graecia
vera). Augustus lavished expensive buildings on Athens, Sparta, and other
cities of the Greek mainland, as well as on his own huge new settlement of
Nicopolis. It may have suited Roman policymakers to promote past Greek
achievements as a way of defusing any sense of resentment on the part of
their Greek-speaking subjects. It could even be that the obsession with past
glories that marks the Greek writers and orators of the Second Sophistic
was something subtly—or not so subtly—foisted upon them by their rulers.
Whatever the case, both sides seem to have gone along with it. Signs of
open discontent are remarkably few.12
Politically speaking, neither ‘true Greece’ nor the wider Greek-speaking
empire was of any strategic importance to the emperors, except on those
occasions when they waged war on the eastern frontiers. Greece itself, in
the form of the provinces of Achaea, Epiros, and Macedonia, had no

military significance. No legions were stationed there. But after Augustus,
Nero in the first century and Hadrian in the second were particularly
fascinated. Both emperors made tours of the east and drew extravagantly on
the imperial treasury to grace selected Greek cities with new buildings and
public spaces. The cities in their turn were extravagantly grateful.
Nero is mostly remembered today as the psychopath who supposedly
‘fiddled while Rome burned’. But even after his memory had been well and
truly damned everywhere else, he still had his admirers in the Greekspeaking east. Nero it was who made the first attempt to cut a canal through
the Isthmus of Corinth, a project not completed until 1893. And in a fit of
generosity, after having been allowed to win contests in all the great
‘panhellenic’ games, which had to be specially rescheduled to fit in with his
visit, Nero granted exemption from all taxes to the entire province of
Achaea. ‘Other princes have liberated cities,’ he declared in a speech at the
Isthmus of Corinth on 28 November 67 CE, but ‘Nero alone has freed a
province’. One enthusiastic beneficiary, echoing a refrain that had long ago
become meaningless, went so far as to thank the emperor for restoring ‘the
freedom of the Greeks, which from the beginning of time has been
indigenous and autochthonous, but had been taken away’.13 Even the very
limited ‘freedom’ that Nero had granted, from liability to pay taxes, would
soon be taken away again by another emperor, and this time for good.
No Roman emperor took a greater interest in what he called ‘Greece’ than
Hadrian, who spent an entire winter in Athens on no fewer than three
occasions during a reign that lasted from 117 to 138 CE. His particular
fondness for the city would result in a building programme that seems to
have been intended to rival those of Pericles and Lycurgus before him. The
results can still be admired today. Among them was the Odeon of Herodes
Atticus, since the mid-twentieth century a prestige venue for open-air
concerts and theatrical performances. Hadrian’s Library was designed to
rival the more famous Library of Alexandria, founded by the Ptolemies.
The Arch of Hadrian and the surviving Corinthian columns of the Temple
of Olympian Zeus, completed on Hadrian’s orders on the banks of the
Ilissos River, still stand in the centre of Athens, serenely rising above the
traffic-filled urban highway that replaced the riverbed in the last century.

Under Hadrian, Athens was declared the capital city of a new organisation
called the Panhellenion. Vaguely modelled on the leagues or temporary
alliances of classical times, the Panhellenion was meaningless politically. It
was mostly about appearances. But it did set the seal of imperial approval
on the supreme cultural position of Athens in the Greek and indeed the
Roman world. In other ways, Hadrian’s innovation was an anachronism.
Membership of the Panhellenion depended on candidate cities providing
proof that their founding fathers had had Greek ancestry.14 Cities that stood
to gain from the emperor’s largesse made ingenious efforts to qualify. But
further afield, the majority of Greek speakers, and certainly the erudite
speech makers whose words we read today, seem to have taken little notice
of Hadrian’s initiative. It is easy to see why. A world in which so many
people of different backgrounds and languages had been ‘becoming Greek’
for the best part of five hundred years could no longer be meaningfully
defined in terms of imagined family trees.
By this time, instead, the view of Isocrates had long ago prevailed in the
Greek world: it was not birth that made a man a Hellene but his
participation in a type of education that had begun in Athens in the fifth
century BCE and that was now enjoying such a vigorous revival. Among
the most admired Greek writers of the age were the satirist Lucian, from
Samosata on the Euphrates (now Samsat in southern Turkey, close to the
Syrian border), and the novelist Heliodorus of Emesa (today’s Homs in
Syria). The first described himself (in elegant Greek) as Syrian by birth, the
second as Phoenician. Even Plutarch, born and bred in Boeotia, in the old
Greek heartland, thought that being Greek was less a matter of race or birth
than of moral qualities that could be learned from reading the best ancient
authors.15
Beyond the cosmetic and short-lived Panhellenion confected by Hadrian,
the larger Greek world of the eastern empire enjoyed a kind of unity that
would never have been possible while the Greeks still possessed their
political ‘liberty’. Isocrates had urged his contemporaries to raise their
sights above the level of the city-state and learn to think of the whole of
Hellas, instead, as their polis. In the scattered, embattled world of the fourth
century BCE, that could never have been more than a dream. But now, in
155 CE, seventeen years after the death of Hadrian, a sophist from Anatolia

by the name of Aelius Aristeides went further in a show speech he delivered
in Rome itself.
The whole Roman Empire, Aristeides informed his listeners, was now one
single polis. The thousands of cities scattered across its length and breadth
were the equivalent of suburbs to imperial Rome.16 In other words, the
highest praise that a devoted disciple of Isocrates could think of, for a world
empire founded on military might, was to make out that it was really just an
inflated version of a Greek polis. It is not recorded what Aristeides’s Roman
audience made of this. Romans had been accustomed, for centuries, to think
of their res publica, as they still called their state, as a proud and unique
creation of their own. No matter, Aristeides was speaking in Greek, and a
very erudite sort of Greek at that. For those who wished to hear, in Rome in
the middle of the second century, the process of ‘becoming Greek’ had
expanded to encompass the whole of Rome’s vast empire.
Six years after that speech was delivered, the emperor Marcus Aurelius
came to the throne. He was a Roman, like all the emperors before him, and
had been brought up in the capital. But, again like many of his
predecessors, he had benefited from a Greek education. For once, when an
emperor took an interest in the Greek world, Marcus’s motive was neither
political nor antiquarian. He had very little opportunity, in the course of a
reign that would last until 180 CE, to spend time in the Greek-speaking
east. Much of his energy had to be devoted to waging the first of Rome’s
defensive wars, fought against Germanic tribes along the Danube frontier.
What attracted Marcus was Greek philosophy. In particular, he was drawn
to the ideas of the Stoics that went back to Zeno of Citium, who had taught
in Athens in the early third century BCE. Stoic ideas had been widely
disseminated and adopted by the Roman elite well before this time. So there
was no reason why Marcus could not have expressed his own philosophical
thoughts and kept his private diary in his own language. But instead he
chose to do so in Greek.
Why he did and whether his Meditations, as they have come to be known,
were really intended for himself alone has been debated by scholars.
Whatever the truth, Marcus’s introspective candour shows an insight into
the mind of an emperor such as is rare, if not unique, in world history. ‘Do
not expect Plato’s ideal commonwealth’, he warns himself at one point.17

What more touching recognition could there be of the limits to imperial
power? He is emperor, after all. And here, perhaps, lies the key to Marcus’s
choice of language. In Latin and in public, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus
Augustus was the supreme commander of armies, ruler of the known world,
god incarnate, recipient of public prayers and sacrifices in temples
everywhere from Hadrian’s Wall in Britain to the Euphrates in today’s Iraq.
But in private and in Greek, the same man faced his own self as a unique,
fallible human being, humble in the face of nature and of a divine power in
which he was not sure he believed, while he struggled to put into words the
consciousness of his own individual humanity.
The questions that exercised Marcus Aurelius towards the end of the
second century CE were by no means confined to his own exalted circles.
Indeed, the philosopher-emperor was giving voice to anxieties and to a type
of introspection that were also very much products of the age. The roots of
these can be traced quite far back into the Hellenistic period.18 But it was
under the Roman Empire that they reached their fullest expression. Part of
what was new can be summed up as the discovery of the human individual.
Another, closely related, was the yearning of each individual, whether great
or humble, to be in some sense ‘saved’. The world of the traditional Greek
polis had been intensely corporate. The highest good had been the survival
and prosperity of the citizen body. This was what public rituals and worship
of the traditional gods had been designed to secure—and always for the
whole community.
Since then, the newer philosophies of the Stoics and Epicureans, among
others, had encouraged their adherents to think about the meaning and
purpose of their own individual lives. But philosophy, for the great majority
of the population, would take you only so far. Minimising pain and making
the most of pleasure were all very well in principle, but thinking about it
wouldn’t make you better if you were ill or save your life when you were in
danger. Worst of all was what happened to you when you died. Lucretius,
the Roman follower of Epicurus back in the first century BCE, had said it
didn’t matter because you wouldn’t be there to worry about it.19 But what if
you still worried in the meantime? This is where a new element, one that
had no real equivalent in the vocabulary of formal Greek or Roman

religion, appears in the thoughts and words of those who wrote in Greek,
namely faith. Faith means something more than sharing stories and
participating in rituals that express the hopes and fears of a whole
community. Faith is personal. Faith means not only that you believe but
also that you place all your trust in a divine force that can do something for
you, personally. Already, by the time of Augustus and for several centuries
thereafter, people were looking for a power beyond themselves that they
could trust in this way.
Alongside official religion and public ceremonies, individuals had begun
entrusting their welfare to new deities and the cults devoted to them. The
bull god Serapis and the goddess Isis had become the objects of empirewide cults that had originated in Egypt under the Ptolemies. In these cults,
elements of older Greek and Egyptian beliefs and ritual practices seem to
have been deliberately fused together to serve the new needs of the age.
During the second century CE, in the same way, the cult of the Persian sun
god Mithras spread through the ranks of the Roman legions to reach into
every corner of the empire. Asclepius, originally a minor Greek deity
associated with healing, came to be worshipped at sanctuaries which by the
Roman period had become more like nineteenth-century sanatoria or the
health spas of today. Patients went through elaborate rituals and slept in the
sanctuary. If they were lucky, the god would visit them in a dream and they
would wake up cured of their ailment. Thousands of inscriptions survive
from all over the Greek-speaking world apparently testifying to the success
of such cures.20
But not even Asclepius could save you when you died. For this need, too,
ritual and some form of religious faith had to be invoked. Initiation by
secret rituals into cults that were called ‘mysteries’ was nothing new. The
most famous of these, the Eleusinian Mysteries, held at Eleusis outside
Athens, had for centuries been a prestigious rite of passage from
adolescence to manhood, not just for Athenians but for Greeks from
elsewhere too. Now, mystery cults were proliferating. It became a matter of
personal choice whether or not to become an initiate, and if so, into which
cult. The secrets of these rituals in the ancient world were remarkably well
kept. But a good indication of what was expected of them comes from the
mid-second century CE, when a would-be initiate into the ‘mysteries’ of the

goddess Isis was told to prepare for ‘a kind of voluntary death and salvation
through divine grace’.21
Among the Greek-speaking elite of the eastern empire, an attempt was
made to address this need in a secular way. This is how the literary genre
that we know today as the novel came to be born in the form of the ‘ancient
Greek novel’, or ‘romance’, which flourished between about 50 CE and
(probably) the early third century. In these stories, boy and girl meet by
chance, fall in love, are separated, and then endure extreme ordeals in the
most exotic places, before they can be reunited and married, to live happily
ever after. Hero and heroine both face the threat of death. Each is willing to
die for the sake of love. In set-piece episodes that lend themselves to the
kind of melodrama characteristic of later horror movies, each appears to be
violently killed, only to be ‘resurrected’ in an apparent miracle.
The most elaborate and technically experimental of these novels is known
as the Aethiopica, or An Ethiopian Story. Its author was Heliodorus of
Emesa, the self-confessed outsider to the Greek-speaking world who was
also a master of elegant Greek prose. Heliodorus in his fiction frequently
plays with a numinous sense of a ‘divine providence’ that ultimately
oversees the happy outcome of the hero’s and heroine’s trials. But the
salvation found in the fulfilment of heterosexual love—itself an innovation
in Greek literature, which had largely preferred homosexuality up to this
time—is purely secular. Through this and other stories, the human self
discovers a purpose for its existence and ultimate salvation in the love of
another in its own likeness.
At the time, and for many centuries afterwards, the exploration of the
condition of the individual self and its search for salvation in the works of
these early Greek novelists would remain a dead end. Too many of these
fictional stories were couched in the old-fashioned language and grandiose
style of the Second Sophistic, accessible only to those with an advanced
education. The novel would have to wait a long time before it could come
into its own, eventually to be hailed in the twentieth century, among many
other things, as a ‘secular scripture’.22 But in the meantime, the road to
salvation for the newly discovered individual would lie through the growth
of an entirely new religion. The scriptures of this religion, too, would be
written first in Greek.

Despite the fact that the near-universal system for reckoning historical
dates today was first created by Christians who counted from the birth of
their religion’s founder, it is now generally accepted that the birth of Jesus
of Nazareth took place in or shortly before 4 BCE. That was the year when
King Herod ‘the Great’, in effect a vassal of Rome, died, and the kingdom
of Judaea was split four ways. Most of Jesus’s life was spent in Galilee,
where the long-running process of ‘becoming Greek’ had scarcely
penetrated.23 It is generally supposed that he and his disciples must have
spoken Aramaic among themselves. This had been the common language of
the Persian Empire before the conquests of Alexander and was still widely
used by ordinary Jews. Jesus himself is said never to have written anything
down. If his immediate followers did, nothing of what they wrote in their
own language has ever come to light.
Jesus’s short life took him to Jerusalem, at the time the capital of the
Roman province of Judaea. There, Greek ways and the Greek language had
been resisted in the past. But by this time, Herod’s former capital had
acquired more than a Greek veneer. Greek was widely spoken there, and
written too, as we know from inscriptions found by archaeologists. It was in
Jerusalem that Jesus was accused of sedition and crucified, the standard
Roman punishment for slaves and criminals who did not enjoy the benefits
of citizenship. It was in Jerusalem, too, during the twenty years or so after
his death in about 30 CE, that his former followers began to disseminate the
message he had taught. This message first makes its mark in the written
record when a Jewish preacher embarked on a mission to spread the new
beliefs beyond the geographical heartland of the Jewish people and to make
converts among the gentiles. To reach this new audience, the message had
to be delivered in a language that everybody could understand. The obvious
choice was Greek. And so Jesus’s message was first, rather modestly,
announced to the wider world as the ‘Good News’, or ‘Gospel’:
Euaggelion, from which come our words ‘evangelist’ and ‘evangelical’.24
The preacher’s name was Paul. No one could have been more different
than Paul from the writers of the Second Sophistic, who were beginning to
set the literary agenda for the eastern empire during his lifetime. His origins
were humble. Originally called Saul, or Shaul, he was born in the city of
Tarsus in the province of Cilicia (today part of southern Turkey) and

brought up there as a Jew; his parents may have been freed slaves. Later
Paul went on to spend time in Jerusalem, where he probably arrived not
long after the crucifixion of Jesus. It was there that he met the surviving
disciples and learnt firsthand about Jesus’s life and teaching. All this would
have taken place in Aramaic. But along the way, Paul had learnt to read and
write in Greek, probably in his home city as a young man. This must have
brought him into some degree of contact with older Greek texts and the
ideas expressed in them. But that was all. The Greek language, for him and
for all the earliest Christian writers whose work we possess, was a means to
an end. Paul’s Greek is the Greek of every day. He used it to write letters,
the most direct means to present information or ideas in permanent form.
Communication by letter was part of the daily life of the Greek-speaking
eastern empire by this time—not a literary genre at all. This was the form
that the great majority of the earliest Christian writings would take.25
Paul’s letters are the oldest Christian texts that we possess. They are
addressed to the embryo Christian communities around the eastern
Mediterranean that he helped to establish. What he writes in them is
extraordinary by comparison with anything that had ever been written in
Greek before. From the earliest of them, written within a few years either
side of 50 CE, we learn that the writer, who introduces himself by name, is
‘an apostle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the
Father, who raised him from the dead)’. ‘Apostle’ is the English form of the
Greek word apostolos, which means ‘missionary’. Jesus had died, the selfdeclared apostle reminds his readers, ‘for our sins, that he might deliver us
from this present evil world’. Here was the promise of salvation indeed.
The way to reach it lay through the cultivation of virtues that must have
seemed at the very least strange to most Greek speakers of the time, quite
possibly incomprehensible: ‘love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
goodness, faith, meekness, temperance’. ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself’, declares Paul in one of his most frequently quoted sentences.26
Paul’s letters have almost nothing to say about Jesus as a historical figure,
about his life, or about the content of his teaching. The stories that we know
from the four Gospels must have been in circulation in some form during
Paul’s lifetime, but the Gospels as we know them had yet to be written. For
Paul, what matters most about Jesus is that he is ‘the Christ’ (Christos).

This was originally not a name in Greek but a title. It translates the Hebrew
‘Messiah’, meaning ‘the anointed one’, and refers to the coronation rituals
of the ancient kings of Israel. As with so much in the New Testament, if the
language is Greek, the concepts conveyed in it belong to a different
tradition entirely, that of the ancient Jews.
What defines the Christ for Paul is the fact that he ‘died for our sins…
was buried, and… rose again the third day’. Christ’s resurrection, the way
Paul tells it, signals a victory over death itself. ‘O death, where is thy sting?
O grave, where is thy victory?’ he writes in one of his most famous
passages. It is also, for Paul, a guarantee of what would later be termed the
‘Second Coming’.27 The first generation of Christians actually believed that
Jesus would come again during their lifetime. When that happened, the
world would end in a fiery conflagration, and God would sit in judgement
on the living and the dead.
By the year 64 CE, the ‘good news’ had spread as far as the empire’s
capital, Rome itself. We know that there was already a Christian community
there, because Paul had addressed its members in a letter written a few
years earlier and, according to one early account, went on to preach in the
city for two years.28 In July of that year, fire broke out in Rome. It raged for
nine days. The entire centre of the city was burned down. To the city’s
Jewish population who had been exposed to Christian teaching, as well as
to the smaller community of committed Christians, it must have seemed as
though the prophecies of the Second Coming were being fulfilled. Although
the connection is made by none of the ancient sources, it may have been
this that inspired the emperor Nero to lay the blame for the catastrophe on
the still obscure Christian sect. The historian Tacitus, writing about fifty
years later, reports:
The confessed members of the sect were arrested; next, on their
disclosures, vast numbers were convicted.… And derision accompanied
their end: they were covered with wild beasts’ skins and torn to death by
dogs; or they were fastened on crosses, and, when daylight failed were
burned to serve as lamps by night.29

Tacitus surely exaggerated the numbers. But the ferocity of Nero’s
scapegoating set a benchmark for cruelty that resonates through later
accounts of a type of persecution that would come to be known by the term
‘martyrdom’ (from a Greek word meaning ‘bearing witness’). According to
tradition, both Paul and Jesus’s former disciple Peter were executed in
Rome as part of this pogrom.
By the time Tacitus came to write up these events in Latin, Christians had
begun to produce their own written narratives of Jesus’s life and death. All
of these, like Paul’s letters and everything else that in due course would go
to make up the Christian New Testament, were written in Greek. First came
the Gospel According to Mark in the early 70s CE. Matthew and Luke
followed not long afterwards, probably during the 80s. These three are often
grouped together and called the ‘synoptic’ Gospels because they share
much material and tell broadly the same story. The Gospel According to
John came later. It is usually dated to between 90 and 110. The attribution
of each Gospel to an ‘evangelist’ was a later invention. By the time that any
of the Gospels came to be written, it is most unlikely that any eye witnesses
to the life and death of Jesus would still have been living.
Mark’s language is the simplest of the four. Luke is at home with a more
‘middlebrow’ style of Greek and shows some familiarity with the culture
that went with it. John goes much further, grafting onto the story not only
the divinity of Jesus as the Christ (an element which emerges only slowly in
the development of early Christianity) but also the identification between
Christ and the divine Logos (meaning ‘word’, ‘reason’, or ‘account’). This
was a Christian extension of an idea that had been explored in a long
philosophical tradition that went back via the Stoics to Plato, and ultimately
to Heraclitus seven hundred years earlier.30
During the second century CE, Christianity attracted very little attention
among the elites of the eastern empire. For those who noticed it at all, such
as the philosopher Celsus, who in the second half of that century wrote a
treatise demonstrating its ‘errors’, the crux of the matter lay in the choice
between faith and reason.31 Faith-based Christianity was very much a
bottom-up movement. Converts seem at first to have been drawn from the
lower classes of society in cities and larger towns—though noticeably not
from the lowest and probably also the largest: the ubiquitous population of

slaves. There is some evidence that the new religion may have attracted
more women than men. And although Paul’s view of women was no more
enlightened than the traditional Greek one, the Roman Empire already
granted considerably more rights to its female subjects than most Greek
states had done. The early Christian church seems to have been more
welcoming to them still.32
Except for a few notorious instances, Christianity during the first two and
a half centuries of its existence spread largely below the radar of the Roman
authorities or the civic institutions of the empire. Individual Christians
could be imprisoned, tortured, and if they refused to recant, executed with
the usual Roman relish for public suffering inflicted upon the outcast. This
was the fate of several prominent Christian leaders and preachers during the
second century. But there was still nothing like a systematic attempt to
persecute the new religion, still less to stamp it out altogether. Martyrs
would remain a tiny minority within a group that in most parts of the
empire was itself, in modern terms, not yet statistically significant.33
Martyrdom had to be actively sought because most Roman authorities
followed the practice attributed in the Gospels to Pontius Pilate, the
governor of Judaea who had condemned Jesus; like Pilate, they would give
the accused every opportunity to avoid the extreme penalty. In official eyes,
Christianity was a mere superstitio. What its adherents believed was of no
importance, so long as they gave proof of their loyalty to the state. It was
political subversion that governors feared and punished, not private belief.
Later Christian tradition would give prominence to the extreme sufferings
of martyrs. For centuries, the fate of these men—and, later, women too—
who had been willing to face a horrific death for their faith, would be held
up as the highest example of Christian virtue.34 But these stories obscure
for us a reality that must have affected far more people at the time and that
would play no less formative a role in the subsequent evolution of
Christianity into the world religion that it has since become: right through
the second century and well into the next, in the Greek-speaking east there
were actually more signs of convergence than of confrontation between
Christianity and the mainstream.
Christians were not the only ones to question whether the ritual killing of
large numbers of animals in the open air was really the best way for humans

to make their peace with a higher power. Galen, the pioneer of medicine
and anatomy who had worked with Marcus Aurelius and died not long after
200 CE, was speaking for the new mentality of the age when he justified his
own scientific study as
a sacred book which I compose as a true hymn to him who created us:
for I believe that true piety consists not in sacrificing many hecatombs
of oxen to him or burning cassia and every kind of unguent, but in
discovering first myself, and then showing to the rest of mankind, his
wisdom, his power and his goodness.35
At about the same time, the citizens of a minor city in southwest Anatolia
called Oenoanda chose to display these lines, couched in the ancient verse
form of Homer, in a prominent position on the outer wall of their city:
Self-born, untaught, motherless, unshakeable,
Giving place to no name, many-named, dwelling in fire,
Such is God: we are a portion of God, his angels.
The inscription goes on to explain that this had been the response of the god
Apollo himself, given through an oracle, when questioned ‘about God’s
nature’.36 Statements like these, two hundred years after the lifetime of
Jesus, are not proof that Christian teaching was directly influential on the
wider Greek-speaking world at this time. Rather, the new religion, and the
new language of faith that had come into existence along with it, addressed
concerns that were also widely shared by non-Christians.
On the other side of the divide, leading Christians were now more likely
than before to have benefited from an education in Greek rhetoric and
philosophy. As the second century gave way to the third, when Christian
writers came to compose the letters, sermons, and treatises in which they set
out their beliefs and argued over the true interpretation of the Gospels, they
did so in a much more elevated language and style than would have been
thinkable for Paul or the evangelists. Starting a little before 200 and
continuing into the middle of the next century, first Clement and then
Origen, both of Alexandria, promoted and discussed the Christian faith in a
language and style that were scarcely less rarefied than those of the Second

Sophistic. These Christian thinkers also brought to their task a profound
knowledge of earlier Greek philosophy, and especially the ideas of Plato,
which at this relatively early stage became permanently grafted onto the
Christian tradition. Before the third century was well advanced, the new
religion had made its accommodation with mainstream Greek education.37
The effects of this convergence would be slow to manifest. But when they
did, they would transform what could be said, or imagined, in Greek ever
afterwards.
According to the English historian Edward Gibbon, whose classic account
was written in the 1770s and 1780s, the ‘decline and fall of the Roman
empire’ began with the death of Marcus Aurelius and the accession of his
son Commodus. These events took place in 180 CE. Commodus today
enjoys an unexpected degree of name recognition in the English-speaking
world, thanks to his portrayal in two blockbuster films, The Fall of the
Roman Empire in 1964 (with Christopher Plummer playing the emperor)
and Gladiator, starring Russell Crowe, in 2000. Much of what these
popular portrayals say about Commodus seems to have been true, including
his assassination in the amphitheatre while dressed as a gladiator.38 But on
the scale of personal vices, Commodus may not have been much worse than
Nero. The difference was that, after Nero committed suicide in 68 CE, the
civil war that followed lasted only a year before the stable system that had
been established by Augustus reasserted itself. After the death of
Commodus in 192 CE, civil war and empire-wide chaos lasted, on and off,
for almost a century.
During the third century, the Roman Empire underwent a series of
profound shocks. The pax Romana was at an end—even though in the
Greek-speaking east it would return. Emperors came and went, raised to
power by the legions they commanded, and as often as not assassinated by
the same soldiers a few months later. The legions, especially those stationed
on the empire’s frontiers, became more important than they had ever been,
as the empire found itself fighting defensive wars on all sides: on the Rhine,
on the Danube, and in the Middle East.
In 224 CE, a new Persian dynasty, the Sassanids, came to power. Within a
few decades they had taken over Rome’s old enemy in the east, the Parthian

kingdom, and reconstituted much of the former strength of the Persian
Empire that had once threatened the Greeks and then been conquered by
Alexander. In 260 CE, the emperor Valerian was taken prisoner, along with
much of his army, while campaigning against them. The great Hellenistic
city of Antioch-on-the-Orontes, which at one time had been the chief city of
the Seleucid kingdom, fell briefly into Persian hands. On the Balkan front,
not long afterwards, a roving band of Goths crossed the Danube and laid
siege to Thessalonica. They went on to ravage the coast of Anatolia as far
south as Ephesus, where they set fire to the famous Temple of Artemis in
262. Another tribe, called Herouloi, from the area of the Crimea, sailed
through the straits from the Black Sea and into the Aegean. Once there, they
caused devastation in Athens and other cities of the Greek mainland and
islands.
People living in places that had not seen warfare for more than two
hundred years found themselves catapulted into a violent and uncertain
world. To compound matters, the empire ran out of money. In order to mint
sufficient coins to pay the legionaries, the amount of precious metal
contained in them had been declining for years. Suddenly, the monetary
system seemed on the edge of collapse. Prices of everyday commodities
soared. Wealthy benefactors no longer funded new buildings or expensive
games—or if they did, they could no longer afford to pay a sculptor to
commemorate the fact in stone. What has been called the ‘epigraphic habit’,
the gift to modern archaeologists that had flourished in the cities of the
Greek east for centuries, came to an abrupt end.39
Beyond the obvious measures, such as doing what they could to defend
their frontiers, different emperors turned to different, more or less extreme
remedies. In 212 CE, during the early years of the third-century ‘crisis’, the
emperor Caracalla took everyone by surprise when he decreed that all
subjects of the empire, other than slaves, would from then on be full Roman
citizens. It may have been nothing more than a short-term expedient to raise
revenue—by vastly extending the tax base. Caracalla did not live long
enough afterwards to explain his reasons. But the effect was permanent and
would profoundly change the character of the Roman Empire. Up to this
point, citizenship had been a prized privilege. According to one modern
estimate, no more than a third, and perhaps as few as a fifth, of all Roman

subjects had been full citizens before this. The change affected over thirty
million people. It has been called ‘one of the biggest single grants of
citizenship—if not the biggest—in the history of the world’.40 But
Caracalla’s supposedly tax-raising stunt would have an even more farreaching consequence. From this time on, almost everyone who spoke
Greek anywhere in the world was entitled to be called a Roman citizen. The
time would come when Greek speakers would no longer think of
themselves as ‘Hellenes’ at all, but rather as ‘Romans’ (Romaioi in Greek)
—as the great majority of them would continue to do until the nineteenth
century.
As the crisis went on, other emperors tried another type of extreme
remedy for their ills. This was to turn back to the corporate mindset of
traditional religion. If things were going so badly for the empire, it must
mean that the gods had been offended. Who could be at fault? Who could
you punish, and be sure that the gods would look kindly on you as a result?
So began the first systematic persecution not just of individual Christians
who fell foul of the Roman authorities but of an entire religion. The first
attempt, by the emperor Decius in 249, seems to have been intended not so
much to create martyrs as to turn Christians back to the official forms of
worship. Many times more sacrificial animals than Christians lost their lives
during the two years that it lasted. But later stories made much of the
horrific sufferings of those Christians who had refused to perform the
prescribed sacrifices. It was an unprecedented intervention by the Roman
state.
After Decius was killed in battle in 251 (the first Roman emperor ever to
suffer this fate), the persecution eased. But it was back with a vengeance a
few years later. The new emperor, Valerian, as he prepared to confront the
Persians who had overrun the easternmost provinces, once again decreed
that all citizens must make animal sacrifices to the gods. In 258, Valerian
went further and ordered the execution of all Christian leaders. Once again,
it was the defeat of the emperor in battle, and his subsequent death in
captivity, that brought about a reprieve two years later. We only know about
these events from later Christian sources, so we have no independent
evidence for what may have been the emperors’ motives.41 After Decius

and Valerian both met their ignominious ends, several decades would pass
before another emperor was ready to repeat the experiment.
It is generally agreed that the crisis experienced throughout the Roman
Empire came to an end with the series of military and economic reforms
instituted by Diocletian, who ruled from 284 to 305. But, for the Christian
minority, the respite would not last long. In March 303, according to
Eusebius, the bishop and historian of the early church who lived through
these events:
an imperial decree was published everywhere, ordering the churches to
be razed to the ground and the Scriptures destroyed by fire, and giving
notice that those in places of honour would lose their places, and
domestic staff, if they continued to profess Christianity, would be
deprived of their liberty.42
Once again, those at the receiving end had no interest in recording what
might have been the reasons for these measures. And we have no other
source of information. In 303, the empire was not under threat—far from it,
a decisive victory over Persia had been won only five years before. And if
Christians were not, this time, being offered up as scapegoats, what other
purpose could there have been to the persecution? Across the empire as a
whole it is likely that by the year 300 CE, Christians amounted to no more
than between 7 and 10 per cent of the population on average. So they can
hardly have been a threat in themselves.43
Whatever the reasons behind the measures taken, their effects would be to
propel Christianity from being a fringe sect and minor social and
administrative irritant to being within a very few years the biggest political
issue to face the Roman state. And once that challenge had been thrown
down, it was Christianity that would emerge triumphant.
Among the reforms instituted by Diocletian was the curious, and in the
event short-lived, innovation of dividing imperial authority four ways. Two
senior and two junior emperors ruled simultaneously, each with
responsibility for a different part of the empire. The ‘tetrarchy’, as this
system was called, could in hindsight be seen as the first tentative gesture

towards the empire’s future division, roughly along the line of the language
division between Latin and Greek. For the time being, though, it was not to
last. The four-way succession to Diocletian was excessively complicated.
The son of one of the previous tetrarchs, by the name of Constantine,
became co-emperor in 306. Probably from the start, Constantine determined
to restore one-man rule. It would take him the best part of twenty years.
Constantine was born in today’s Niš in southern Serbia. His mother,
Helen, may have come from a Greek-speaking family. But his own first
language was Latin. Benefiting from the usual upper-class education,
Constantine would have learned to read Greek, but was apparently never
very fluent in it.44 His first imperial responsibility was for the empire’s
most westerly provinces. Indeed, it was at York, in England, that the troops
who had been loyal to his father proclaimed him co-emperor. Despite this, it
would be in the east that Constantine would leave by far the greater legacy.
Exactly what role Christianity played in Constantine’s early life has been
hotly disputed ever since. All we know for certain is that in 313, with the
tetrarchy now reduced from four to two, Constantine and his last remaining
co-emperor, Licinius, issued a joint proclamation that officially ended the
persecution of Christians throughout the empire.45
In Christian circles, stories were soon circulating about a vision that
Constantine had seen while he had been preparing for a campaign to
eliminate one of his imperial rivals. The campaign had ended in a
spectacular victory that gave Constantine control of Rome in October 312.
In the fullest account of this vision, circulated by Eusebius in a biography
of Constantine written shortly after his death and allegedly reported on
oath:
About the time of the midday sun, when day was just turning, he said he
saw with his own eyes, up in the sky and resting over the sun, a crossshaped trophy formed from light, and a text attached to it which said,
‘By this conquer’.
The following night, so the story went on, Constantine had dreamed that
‘the Christ of God’ came to him and ordered him to fashion a military
standard in the form of the Christian cross.46 So far, so traditional.

Constantine had found a new divine patron. Greek and Roman history is
full of such portents. Commanders of armies had set great store by them
since at least the time of the Persian Wars. Still within the bounds of
tradition, during the next few years, as co-emperor with responsibility for
the western half of the empire, he paid appropriate respects, in return, by
paying for the building and adorning of Christian churches in Rome.
What made it political was that at the same time, Licinius, now
Constantine’s only remaining imperial rival, began a new persecution of
Christians in the east. This meant going back on the agreement that the two
men had reached and their joint proclamation. Now, one co-emperor was
backing the new religion in one half of the empire, the other trying to
eliminate it in the other. So the stage was set for the final struggle for
supremacy between the two. Constantine defeated Licinius in September
324 in a battle fought on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus. Whether
intended or not, his campaign to make himself sole emperor had turned into
a war of liberation on behalf of the Christian minority. In a letter to
Eusebius, written shortly after his victory over Licinius, Constantine
explained it like this:
But now, with liberty restored and that dragon driven out of the public
administration through the providence of the supreme God and by our
service, I reckon that the divine power has been made clear to all, and
that those who through fear or want of faith have fallen into sins, and
have come recognize That which really Is, will come to the true and
right ordering of life.47
From this point on, there could be no going back. Politically, Constantine
had won his supremacy as the champion of an oppressed minority—and of
the God that they worshipped. He now had no choice but to deliver. The
traditional two-way transaction between gods and favoured mortals would
never work again. Perhaps by this time, more than a century after Marcus
Aurelius, Galen, and the Oenoanda inscription, no one really believed in it
anyway. You couldn’t negotiate with the one god of the Christians. Nothing
less than total obedience would do. It was the perfect religion for an
autocratic political system.

The price for Constantine was to forgo the divinity that had been the
traditional entitlement of Roman emperors while alive and formal
deification after death. Instead, when the time came for him to die, in
Nicomedia (today’s Turkish city of Izmit) in 337, shortly after celebrating
the newly instituted festival of Easter, Constantine became the first Roman
emperor to be ‘initiated by rebirth in the mysteries of Christ’ when he
received the Christian rite of baptism. Eusebius describes the dying emperor
as transfigured, as he ‘put on bright imperial clothes which shone like light,
and rested on a pure white couch, being unwilling to touch a purple robe
again’.48
Constantine’s personal motives and the nature, or sincerity, of his
conversion have been the subject of controversy in modern times. Was he
essentially a traditionalist who realised too late how radical a revolution he
had started? Or was he perhaps a realist who recognised a new spirit of the
age and decided to make a virtue of the inevitable? Maybe he was one of
those rare, true innovators who are willing to risk the challenge of the new
in the knowledge that they cannot possibly foresee where it might lead? The
dedicated champion of the faith depicted by Eusebius is too onedimensional to be credible—unless one believes, with Eusebius, that battles
and military campaigns are won by faith alone. Constantine was a canny
and successful ruler over a still-mighty empire, one of very few in three
centuries. Devout Christian or not, he was not above putting his own son
and first wife to death for reasons of cold politics. It may be that what
mattered most to Constantine was to restore order to a disordered empire
and that he saw in Christianity the means to do it. Whether he was right or
not may still be an unanswered question almost two thousand years later.49
In any case, at the time of Constantine’s baptism and death, Christianity
was not yet the official, still less the only, religion of the Roman Empire.
But the adoption of the new religion by the most powerful man in the world
had consequences for Christianity, too. Overnight, a bottom-up movement
had become top-down. One of Constantine’s first acts after defeating
Licinius and becoming sole emperor was to convene a conference of
Christian bishops at Nicaea (today’s Iznik), in northwest Anatolia, to decide
between the rival interpretations of the faith that were in circulation at the
time. It has aptly been observed that the intention behind this and later

‘ecumenical councils’, as such meetings came to be called, was not to
encourage debate but to quash dissent.50
The official definition of the Christian faith that came out of that meeting
is known as the ‘Nicene Creed’. The same Greek text, translated into many
different languages, is still recited by congregations in Christian churches
around the world. It begins, ‘I believe…’ The Nicene Creed establishes
belief as an act of public declaration. And as such it has remained the basis
of the Christian faith ever since. For the first time, it mattered what people,
collectively and individually, declared in front of their peers that they
believed. In this way, private belief or opinion (doxa in Greek) was drawn
into the public sphere, where it could potentially be regulated or controlled.
Religion was political, from that time on, in a way that it never had been
before. A word that had barely existed up to this time had to be pressed into
service to give expression to the novel idea. This was orthodoxia, meaning
‘correct belief’. Christianity as a state religion begins not with Jesus of
Nazareth or with Paul the Apostle but with the Council of Nicaea in 325
CE. At the same moment, too, begins the history of the world’s troubled
relations between religion and politics.
Another decision by Constantine would have almost as great an effect on
later world history. Once again, the sequel would be quite out of proportion
to anything that Constantine himself could have intended. It had been a
common practice, going back at least as far as Alexander, for victorious
Hellenistic kings and Roman generals or emperors to found new cities or
reestablish old ones and to name them (in Greek) after themselves: wellknown examples are Philippopolis (Plovdiv in today’s Bulgaria) and
Hadrianopolis (Adrianople in English, now the Turkish city of Edirne).
Often, the location would be chosen close to the site of a spectacular
victory. Constantine decided to be no different. More or less opposite the
place where he had beaten Licinius, on the European side of the Bosphorus,
was a small, half-ruined Greek city, built on a promontory between a long
inlet and the Sea of Marmara. This city was already a thousand years old—
if it is true that its first settlers had come from Megara, near the Isthmus of
Corinth, in the seventh century BCE. It was a good strategic site,
surrounded by water on three sides and overlooking the straits that separate
Europe from Asia. Its name was Byzantium.

The inauguration of the refounded city took place with much pomp and
circumstance on 11 May 330 CE.51 The new city was an imperial
foundation; one of the first institutions to be created for it was a Senate,
modelled on the traditional aristocratic assembly of Rome. But it was not
yet a capital. Constantine would make his home there for most of the years
that remained to him. It was, of course, in Greek that the emperor named his
city: Konstantinoupolis, or Constantinople, meaning ‘city of Constantine’.
For the first time ever, and almost by accident, the Greek-speaking world
had acquired a political centre, one that would remain unchallenged for
almost eight centuries and would never entirely lose its symbolic resonance
for Greeks thereafter.

BECOMING CHRISTIAN
337–630

A

t the time of Constantine’s deathbed baptism in 337, the overwhelming

majority of his subjects were still pagans. That is to say, they worshipped
the traditional Greek and Roman gods in the traditional ways. Civil life still
revolved around temples and sanctuaries as it always had done. Even the
emperor’s new city on the Bosphorus had its share of those. Indeed, while
the building had been going on, Constantine had sent his agents to scour the
precincts and public spaces of the eastern empire for bronze and marble
statues to be shipped to Constantinople. Many of these ended up adorning
the Hippodrome, newly built for the popular sport of chariot racing and
long to remain at the civic heart of the city. Some of these monuments even
survive today in the open space opposite the Blue Mosque that preserves
the shape of the ancient race course. Eusebius would have us believe that
Constantine’s purpose in gathering all these ancient art objects had been to
force the unconverted ‘to renounce their error, when the emperor held up
the very objects of their worship to be the ridicule and sport of all
beholders’.1 Sometimes the bishop protests too much.
In fact, Constantine and the three of his sons who succeeded him moved
cautiously in imposing Christianity on the empire. There was no attempt to
repeat the excesses of their predecessors against Christians and create a new
round of martyrs. To begin with, there was little even in the way of
legislation. Instead, people were nudged towards the new religion by the
exercise of high-level patronage. In Constantinople and the cities of the
east, cash donations from emperors, generous tax breaks to Christian

individuals and institutions, and state funding to build churches all had their
effect, cumulatively, over several decades. But change was gradual. And
perhaps even more important were grassroots movements from below. Even
now, Christianity had not lost the bottom-up momentum of its earliest years.
This was particularly evident in some of the empire’s provinces: in Egypt,
Syria, and Mesopotamia. Far more numerous than the martyrs who had
preceded them, new generations of religious pioneers would once again
prominently include women as well as men. And they would come from all
walks of life, including the humblest. These were the people who would
soon come to embody, in the minds of millions, the purest expression of the
Christian life.
Some set out alone for deserts or mountains, to emulate the episode
reported in the Gospels when Jesus retreated to the wilderness for forty
days and was tempted by the Devil. Known variously as ‘hermits’ or
‘ascetics’, these individuals subjected themselves to ferocious conditions
and privations, deliberately tormenting their bodies so as to perfect the soul
within and prepare it for a better life after death. Just as Christ had fought
against Satan, so these ascetics saw themselves as engaged in a cosmic
struggle. The hermits who proliferated throughout Syria and Mesopotamia
have been described as ‘wild vagrants dressed in skins, their matted hair
making them look like eagles’. ‘Men of fire’, they ‘amazed and disquieted
the Greco-Roman world by their histrionic gestures’. But they were not just
loners. Turning their backs on society, the ascetics found that society came
to them. People sought them out for moral guidance, to cast out demons, or
just to gape and marvel at their endurance. A century after the time of
Constantine, crowds would gather near Aleppo to gaze up at the top of a tall
column where Saint Symeon Stylites lived for thirty-seven years perched on
a small platform, sustained by food supplied by the local faithful and drawn
up in baskets. Men and women such as these were the popular heroes and
heroines of the day.2
Others created whole communities with similar aims. In Egypt, a villager
by the name of Pachomius, who had converted to Christianity while serving
in the Roman legions, seems to have been one of the first to establish a
system of communal living for segregated groups of men and women,
under strict religious rules and keeping their distance from towns and cities.

By the time that Pachomius died in 346, nine of these ‘monasteries’, as they
came to be known, were in existence in Egypt. Those who submitted to the
rule of a monastery were known as ‘monks’. The Greek word monachos
literally means ‘one all alone’, a description that better fits the hermits and
solitary ascetics than members of the communities founded by Pachomius
and others. A hundred years later, there may have been as many as fifteen
thousand monks living in Egypt, including at least four hundred nuns.3
Many of those would have spoken Coptic, a form of ancient Egyptian that
was also gaining ground as a written language among Christians. But the
lives of the founders were written in Greek and widely read throughout the
eastern empire. It was to the monks and hermits of their own localities that
ordinary people looked for an example of how to live as Christians, as
much as to distant emperors laying down the law in Constantinople.
And yet, during an extraordinary period of twenty months, beginning in
November 361, it looked as though the whole process might be about to go
into reverse. On the death of his last surviving son, Constantius II,
Constantine’s thirty-year-old cousin Julian, who had already proclaimed
himself co-emperor in the west, became master of the entire Roman world.
Posterity would remember Julian as the ‘Apostate’ or (in Greek until today)
the ‘Transgressor’. On his father’s side, he was descended from the same
Latin-speaking Balkan family as Constantine. Like Constantine, he had a
Latin name. But his mother tongue, literally, was Greek. Julian was born
and spent his earliest years in Constantinople. From there, he went on to
study philosophy, grammar, and rhetoric in Athens. His military honours
and ranks were all won in the west, where he commanded the legions in
battle against German invaders from across the Rhine. But despite this,
Julian’s heart and mind would always remain rooted in the Greek-speaking
east.4
Even among Roman emperors, Julian was an oddball. Bearded in the
manner of ancient Greek philosophers, he could boast of an intellectual
training unmatched by any previous emperor, except Marcus Aurelius
(whom he greatly admired). He came to the throne determined not just to
suppress the new religion of Constantine but to replace it with something
that in its way was almost as much of a novelty. Julian’s project went
further than restoring the old practices of animal sacrifice and festivals in

honour of the traditional gods (many of which were still continuing
anyway). Julian was religious in a sense that would have been
incomprehensible to most Greeks in the heyday of the classical Athens that
he held in such esteem. He shared with the Christian ascetics a revulsion for
the flesh. He had been brought up to be a Christian, after all.
Devoted though he was to Greek philosophy, it was faith in a supernatural
higher power, not the power of human reason, that inspired Julian. What the
new emperor demanded of his subjects was uniformity of belief. The idea of
orthodoxia, that had entered the language of official religion with the
Nicene Creed, was now to be applied to the ancient myths and legends
about the Greek gods. Conceding that Greek literature possessed nothing of
its own to match the divine revelation contained in the sacred texts of
Christians or Jews, Julian called for the old stories to be interpreted anew.5
Soon the religion he was promoting began to look and sound less like the
old one it was supposed to restore and more like Christianity itself.
The task that Julian set himself was to turn the curriculum of a traditional
Greek education into the basis for a religious faith. Those who shared in
that education had long been proud to call themselves ‘Hellenes’. This was
merely a reflection of the deeply embedded acceptance that it was
education, not birth, that defined a person as ‘Hellenic’. Now, in Greek, the
word ‘Hellene’ began to be used in the sense of ‘pagan’. It may even have
been Julian himself who first used it in this new sense. A long-term
consequence of his ‘apostasy’ was that it would stick. Until the end of the
eighteenth century, it would be standard practice in Greek to restrict the
meaning of ‘Hellenes’ to those who either stood out against Christianity or
had lived too long ago to be able to share in the salvation it offered—in
other words, ancient Greeks.
It all came to an end suddenly on 26 June 363. While leading an
expedition against Sassanid Persia, Julian was struck by a spear and died
shortly afterwards. Had he succeeded, he might have turned the eastern
empire into something resembling a Greek state, defined by its culture and
religion, as well as language. His failure also helps to explain why the
Greek-speaking Christian empire that would soon become independent of
Rome would ever afterwards continue to identify itself and its people not as
Greeks (Hellenes) but as Romans (Romaioi). In hindsight, a newly

rebranded ‘Hellenic’ religion could only ever have appealed to an elite,
while Christianity was proving that it really was for everyone.6
Despite this, the eastern empire would never turn its back on the language
and the educational curriculum that were also called ‘Hellenic’. Greek was
after all the language of Christianity too. If the earliest Christian writers had
been little versed in the Greek classics or the art of rhetoric, the deficiency
had been made good long before this. In Julian’s day, the leading Christian
theologians had been through exactly the same education in the Greek
language and the Greek classics as he had. Indeed, two of the bishops still
remembered as ‘Fathers of the Church’, Saint Basil the Great and Saint
Gregory of Nazianzus, had been Julian’s fellow students in Athens.
Together with Basil’s brother, Saint Gregory of Nyssa, and Saint John
Chrysostom in the next generation, these men would go on to exercise an
enormous influence to ensure that Christians would not forsake a system of
learning that had served their own teachers so well for so long.7
The campaign that cost Julian his life was part of a series of wars on the
empire’s eastern frontier that would drag on inconclusively for most of the
next three centuries. On other fronts, too, the empire that had been founded
on conquest was being forced onto the defensive. Germanic tribes had been
crossing the Rhine into today’s France—indeed, it had been in battle against
them that Julian had first won his spurs before he became emperor. In the
Balkans, others were coming across the Danube and settling in large
numbers in Roman territory. In 378, an army of Goths defeated the Roman
legions outside Adrianople (today’s Edirne), only one hundred and fifty
miles from Constantinople. The emperor Valens was killed in that battle.
But the Goths failed to follow up on their victory. Gradually, and for the
time being, the immediate threat to the eastern parts of the empire receded.
But as the fourth century came to a close, the reality could no longer be
denied: the foundations of the thousand-year-old Roman state were starting
to crack.
Holding the vast structure of the empire together under these pressures
was proving too much for emperors, senators, and dispersed military
commands. For what happened next, the model of systems collapse has
often been invoked by modern historians.8 First of all, in 395, the empire

was formally divided when Theodosius I, on his deathbed, split the
succession between his two sons. Almost immediately, the western half
began to disintegrate. Rome itself was sacked by a Gothic army in 410, then
again by another Germanic invader, the Vandals, in 455. Nominally, the
western empire would limp on until 476, when the last emperor of Rome
would be unceremoniously deposed and replaced by a German who took
the Latin title of rex, or king, that to Romans had long been taboo. By that
time, the Roman Empire in the west had already broken up into a
patchwork of petty kingdoms. This would remain the reality for centuries to
come.
Constantinople was now on its own—no longer an imperial capital but the
capital of the only Roman Empire that still existed. And it still was an
empire, of perhaps thirty million people. Its territory stretched from the
Danube in the north to the first cataract on the Nile at Aswan in the south
and from the Balkan shoreline of the Strait of Otranto in the west to the
Euphrates in the east. All the mechanisms remained in place for taxes to be
raised and for grain to be shipped from Egypt to the capital and the empire’s
other great cities. In most of the eastern provinces, levels of population and
prosperity were once again on the rise.
This meant there was plenty of manpower to supply the ranks of the
legions and to build and to crew ships. Since the time of Constantine, a new
source of gold had been found far away in the Caucasus—a discovery that
seems not to have been shared with the ‘twin’ empire in the west but
provided the basis for a currency that would keep its value undiminished for
hundreds of years.9 Under Theodosius II, who reigned from 408 to 450, the
empire could mobilise the resources required to build the massive series of
fortifications for the capital, known as the ‘Theodosian Walls’, that are still
an impressive part of the cityscape of modern Istanbul. For the next century
and more, while the remains of the Roman Empire in the west continued to
fragment, the fortunes of the eastern empire were set to rise still further.
Officially, when the empire had been divided, the line had been drawn
between administrative regions. But the real division was the long-standing
one of language and culture that had existed since the time of Augustus. It
was during the reign of Theodosius II that the Greek-speaking east began
belatedly to acquire a political existence of its own. Even so, it was still not

quite a Greek empire. Latin continued to be spoken and written at the very
top—by the emperor, by his immediate family, at the highest levels of the
administration, and by the most senior ranks in the army. And in both
halves of the empire, ever since Caracalla’s grant of Roman citizenship
almost two hundred years before, people had become accustomed to think
of themselves as ‘Romans’. The difference in the east was that they did so
in Greek, not Latin. They were Romaioi, not Romani. ‘Hellenes’, of course,
had been given a bad name by Julian. Only those who still hankered after
his failed project might still describe themselves in that way. With the
collapse of the empire in the west, its eastern counterpart became, in reality,
an entirely new and independent state, at once Greek by language and
Roman in name: ‘a Greek Roman empire’.10
By the time of Theodosius II, it was also well on the way to becoming a
Christian empire. New ecumenical councils were convened as new
controversies erupted over the interpretation of matters of doctrine. The
most contentious of these was how to understand the double nature of Jesus
Christ as at once human and divine. Another was to define the Trinity,
consisting of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in such a way as
not to seem to dilute the principle of ‘one God’, or monotheism—a
complaint levelled by nonbelievers from that time to this. These debates
may seem arid and abstract, even abstruse, today, but at the time the issues
were capable of arousing the passions of large sections of the population.
On the distinction between defining the nature of Christ as either
homoousios (of the same substance) or homoioousios (of similar substance)
as God the Father, the allegiance of whole provinces could be won or lost.
In Egypt and the Levant, the overwhelming majority of the faithful
preferred a more rigorously monotheistic definition to the one that had been
officially adopted at Nicaea in 325. But the double nature of Christ was
reaffirmed in 451 at the council held at Chalcedon, on the opposite side of
the Bosphorus from Constantinople. The finest intellects of the day were at
once trying to keep pace and to guide the passions of the faithful. They also
bickered shamelessly among themselves. Only the dogmatic determination
of an emperor, in this case the successor to Theodosius II, Marcian, could
push through a resolution and try to enforce it, as Constantine had done. But
time and again, a single ‘correct belief’ (orthodoxia) would prove hard to

foist upon unwilling subjects, even while Christianity was steadily gaining
ground to become the majority religion and pagans were pushed more and
more onto the defensive.11
The tipping point seems to have come around the start of the fifth century.
But that still left a sizeable population of pagans, or ‘Hellenes’, who either
remained unconverted or actively resisted conversion.12 Even before the
empire’s division, the first Theodosius had begun legislating to ban pagan
practices. Under Theodosius II, pagans were banned from serving in the
highest ranks of the civil service and the judiciary. It is often hard to tell
how thoroughly these and other sanctions were enforced, or how effective
they were. There was never a policy of systematic persecution of pagan
‘Hellenes’. But there was little, either, to prevent outbreaks of spontaneous
violence against individuals, institutions, or buildings. Usually, these would
be spurred on by local leaders. On occasion, even an emperor would turn a
blind eye.
In Alexandria, in 391, bands of zealot thugs, loyal to one of the leasttolerant bishops of the time by the name of Cyril, burnt down the vast
temple complex dedicated to the Egyptian bull god Serapis, known as the
Serapeum. It was the same Cyril who a few years later decided to round up
and expel all the city’s Jews—probably one of the largest Jewish
communities anywhere in the world at this time. This was in 415. In the
mayhem that ensued, a Christian mob targeted one of Alexandria’s most
prominent and respected ‘Hellene’ ladies. Hypatia was a teacher of
philosophy and mathematics at the Mouseion, the institute of learning
founded by the Ptolemies some seven hundred years before. The story of
what happened next we owe to a horrified contemporary, himself a
Christian and a historian of the church:
They dragged her from her carriage, took her to the church called
Caesareum, where they completely stripped her, and then murdered her
with tiles. After tearing her body in pieces, they took her mangled limbs
to a place called Cinaron, and there burnt them.13
Episodes such as this have invited comparison with the terrorist acts of
Islamist extremists in the twenty-first century. Palmyra in Syria, whose

well-preserved remains were targeted by ISIS fighters in 2015, had been
attacked and had sustained similar damage in 385 while still a living city—
on that occasion at the hands of militant Christians from the desert.14 But it
is worth noting that (again, like Islamist terrorism today) these were the acts
of extremist individuals and groups. They were not ordered by the state.
Most emperors, until well into the sixth century, seem to have been content
to promote a policy of gradual assimilation rather than sudden coercion.
As a result, throughout this time, pockets of pagan beliefs and customs
continued to coexist with a now dominant Christian culture. The last
Olympic Games had been held at Olympia in 393, before the festival was
closed down by order of Theodosius I. But their namesake at Antioch
would keep going until 520. At some point along the way, athletes no
longer exercised naked. Soon, it seems that nobody was exercising at all.
The Greek word for physical exercise, askesis, had already been
conscripted by the ‘ascetics’ of the new faith.
Theatrical performances involving singing, dancing, and slapstick comedy
had been popular all over the Greek east for centuries. Called ‘mimes’ or
‘pantomimes’, these seem to have been the last gasp of the venerable
tradition of Greek drama. Christian preachers weighed in against the
‘dishonourable’ profession of the ‘laughter-maker’ and ‘the man of many
disguises, the unstable man, the easy man, the man who becomes all
things’. Just so far had the mentality of the Greek-speaking world moved on
from Homer’s Odysseus ‘of many wiles’ and certainly of many disguises. If
ever there was a definitive ‘closure of the theatres’, like that of Puritan
England in the seventeenth century, we don’t know when it happened. But
along with less innocuous forms of entertainment, such as gladiatorial fights
and wild beast shows, the Greek theatrical tradition certainly came to an
end. Play texts were read and studied as part of an education that was still
considered suitable for Christians—but for their language and style, no
longer as living drama.15
Everyday life was changing, too. Constantine had given new secular
powers to the highest local authorities of the church, the bishops. The Greek
word for ‘bishop’, episkopos, from which the English is derived, literally
means ‘overseer’. Charismatic and often highly educated, these men were
elected for life, unlike municipal officials or provincial governors. By the

fifth century, it was more often to bishops than to magistrates or imperial
appointees that people looked for leadership in towns and cities. In the past,
prominent citizens had vied with one another to pay for games, spectacular
shows and buildings, and in this way to earn the gratitude of their poorer
peers. Now, bishops channelled spare wealth to create hospices for the
needy and the sick. Christian charity had become a civic duty by the fifth
century. Bishops were not themselves either poor or humble. But they did
preach the virtues of compassion, humility, and forgiveness, virtues which
had no counterpart in older Greek thinking or behaviour. Above all, they
preached the worth of every human being. And they preached the
possibility of eternal salvation for the individual soul.16
The physical appearance of cities was being transformed at the same time.
Ancient temples, with their long colonnades, still stood. But those that had
not been converted into churches lay abandoned or in ruins. Worshippers no
longer congregated in the open air in front of them. Outdoor altars no
longer smoked with burnt offerings meant for the gods. Massed male
citizens no longer feasted on the edible parts of ritually slaughtered animals.
Worship had moved into the enclosed spaces of interiors which had never
featured much in pagan worship. Perhaps this was a reflection of the
movement from the extrovert and communal towards the inner world of the
experiencing individual that marks the whole transition towards
Christianity.
But there was one aspect of urban life that no amount of pious exhortation
by the ‘Fathers of the Church’ could suppress. In Constantinople and in
every large city of the eastern empire, crowds still flocked to the
Hippodrome to watch their favourite riders race chariots against each other.
Perhaps it was because so many other forms of public entertainment were
being shut down, or withering away, that this one not only bucked the trend
but actually grew in the numbers it attracted and the intensity of the
passions it aroused. Originally, there had been four teams, all named after
colours. But, by the end of the fifth century, just about everyone, from the
emperor downwards, was a supporter of either the Blues or the Greens—
and not just at Constantinople but in all the larger cities, such as
Thessalonica or Antioch.

Since at least the time of Theodosius I in the late fourth century, rioting
between supporters of the rival teams had often led to bloodshed. From
today’s perspective, these public convulsions have been compared to
football hooliganism. For once, it seems they had little or nothing to do with
religion. The fans of the Blues and the fans of the Greens were nothing like
political parties or even, probably, factions with a consistent political
agenda. But by the start of the next century, in Constantinople, they were
operating as political pressure groups powerful enough to make or break an
emperor.17
When the emperor Anastasius died in July 518 at the age of eighty-seven,
no plans had been put in place for the succession. The next highest
authority in Constantinople lay with the Senate, that had been established
by Constantine along Roman lines from the beginning. Unlike the original
Senate, though, this one had never much say in the governing of the empire
—except in a situation like this. It was supposed to be for the senators to
name the new emperor. But power to control the streets lay elsewhere. The
Hippodrome, built to accommodate a hundred thousand people, filled up
with a chanting crowd. No doubt there had been work behind the scenes. It
would be claimed afterwards that money had changed hands. The
commander of the palace guard, a grizzled old soldier by the name of
Justin, was certainly well placed to work the crowd. Before the day was
over, Justin had entered the royal box in the Hippodrome and was being
hailed as emperor by supporters of both Blues and Greens. This was to be
the way for power to be transferred from one emperor to another on several
occasions during the remainder of the century and well into the next.18
Justin was already in his seventies when he took office. When he died
nine years later in 527, he had already appointed his nephew and adopted
son, Justinian, to succeed him. The younger man was then aged about fortyfive. According to a pen portrait written towards the end of his reign, almost
forty years later:
In appearance he was short, with a good chest, a good nose, fairskinned, curly-haired, round-faced, handsome, with receding hair, a
florid complexion, with his hair and beard greying.

Most of these details can be confirmed from surviving images made out of
mosaic in the Italian city of Ravenna during Justinian’s lifetime. The writer,
a loyal civil servant from Antioch by the name of John Malalas, adds,
perhaps dutifully: ‘He was magnanimous and Christian’. The historian of
Justinian’s reign, Procopius of Caesarea, who had an axe to grind, although
we do not know why, shows both sides of the man he certainly knew
personally:
He showed himself approachable and affable to those with whom he
came into contact; not a single person found himself denied access to
the Emperor, and even those who broke the rules of etiquette… never
incurred his wrath.… He never gave even a hint of anger or irritation to
show how he felt towards those who had offended him, but—with a
friendly expression on his face and without raising an eyebrow—in a
gentle voice he would order tens of thousands of quite innocent people
to be put to death, cities to be overturned and the confiscation of all their
money by the Treasury.19
Justinian is probably best remembered today for commissioning the
monumental codification of the entire corpus of Roman law that still bears
his name. Announced within a year of his accession, in 528, its several
stages were completed in only five years. Wherever legal systems today are
said to be based on Roman law, it is the work of Justinian’s legal teams that
is meant. This massive compilation was of course made in Latin, the
language of the much older original documents that were edited and
harmonised in the process. But as well as tidying up the corpus of
lawmaking that his officials had inherited, Justinian would soon become a
prolific lawmaker himself. Beginning in the 530s, new laws would be
drafted not in Latin but in Greek. By the decision of an emperor who was
himself a Latin speaker, Greek had at last reached all the way to the top to
become the language of imperial legislation.
Along with all this legal activity, it is hardly surprising to see the full
force of the law directed against the last outposts of pagan beliefs and
practices that still existed in the empire. Right at the beginning of
Justinian’s first compilation of laws, issued in 529, comes this directive:

All people who are ruled by the administration of our clemency shall
practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to
the Romans. We command that those who follow this law shall embrace
the name of Catholic [i.e., universal] Christians.
Other laws for the first time prohibited homosexual practices, overturning
centuries of tolerance—even, in the case of classical Athens, celebration—
of same-sex relationships. Also in 529, according to Malalas:
There was a great persecution of Hellenes. Many had their property
confiscated.… The emperor issued a decree and sent it to Athens
ordering that no-one should teach philosophy nor interpret the laws; nor
should gaming be allowed in any city, for some gamblers who had been
discovered in Byzantion had been indulging themselves in dreadful
blasphemies. Their hands were cut off and they were paraded around on
camels.20
The philosophers seem at least to have been more humanely treated than
the gamblers. A few decamped for a time to Persia. But the ease with which
a pious civil servant could equate the great philosophical schools that went
back to Plato and Aristotle with the gambling dens above the Bosphorus is
revealing of the attitude of the time. Athens would never again be a centre
of learning until the nineteenth century. At Alexandria, the teaching of
philosophy would continue for a hundred years more—but with Christian
teachers.21 The eastern empire was not only becoming more Greek, under
Justinian it was also becoming more uniformly Christian, more centralised
and autocratic than ever before.
But it soon turned out that Justinian was not yet secure on his throne.
Trouble began, once again, with the fan clubs of the chariot-racing teams,
the Blues and the Greens. Nobody could be above the fray. Justinian
himself, according to Procopius, was a Blue supporter. In January 532, a
flashpoint came when popular charioteers fell foul of the authorities. Soon
fighting broke out in the Hippodrome in front of the emperor. Crowds
massed in the centre of the city. True to form, the confrontation was rapidly
becoming political. When supporters of the Greens demanded the dismissal
of three of the emperor’s highest officials, Justinian gave way. But even this

was not enough to quell what Procopius called the ‘mob’. Massed voices
called on the emperor himself to resign. Chanting ‘Win! Win!’ (Nika in
Greek), as they must have done regularly to cheer on their favourite
charioteers, some began to hail one of their own ringleaders as emperor.
Ever since, the event has been known to historians as the Nika riot.
According to Procopius, it was the emperor’s wife, Theodora, who
stiffened Justinian’s resolve at this moment of crisis. By the time that
imperial troops had restored order several days later, some thirty thousand
citizens lay dead in the Hippodrome and the surrounding streets. Much of
the centre of the city had gone up in flames, including the cathedral Church
of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia in Greek).22
The sequel would change the geopolitics of the entire Mediterranean for
the better part of two centuries and the cityscape of Justinian’s capital to
this day. The emperor had come very close to being deposed by the power
of the mob. He had been saved by the resolve of his empress and the
bravery and resourcefulness of the commander of his guard, a general by
the name of Belisarius. Justinian now had to prove himself in the eyes of his
subjects. What he needed was a war. And he needed to win. The chants
hurled at him by the rioters in the Hippodrome must still have been ringing
in his ears.
A campaign against Persia had been going badly. But suddenly, in 533, a
new opportunity presented itself in the west. Peace was hastily patched up
with the Persians, and that June, Belisarius sailed out of the Bosphorus at
the head of a fleet of six hundred warships, bound for the Mediterranean.
Their objective was North Africa. For the past hundred years, the former
Roman provinces there had been under the control of the Vandals, the
Germanic tribe that had sacked Rome for the second time in 455.
On 15 September, Belisarius entered Carthage, the Vandals’ capital.
Within a year, the entire North African coast had been brought once again
under Roman rule. Belisarius himself returned to the capital to celebrate in
a manner that has the ring of an old Roman triumph, being carried aloft
through the streets by Vandal captives on New Year’s Day 535. But this was
only the beginning. A second expedition that same year wrested Sicily from
the Ostrogoths, who controlled all of Italy and part of the northern Balkans.
A new campaign began on the Italian mainland. Rome itself opened its

gates to Belisarius in December 536. The Ostrogoths withdrew their troops
to defend their capital, Ravenna, farther north on the Adriatic coast. Three
years later, Belisarius had Ravenna under close siege and finally took the
city in May 540.23
It had been an astonishing run of victories. Justinian gave orders for a
column to be erected near his palace. Plated with brass, it was topped by a
gigantic equestrian statue of himself holding a globe in his hand to
symbolise his conquest of the entire world. The column and the statue
would stand for close on a thousand years.24 As the decade of the 530s
ended, Justinian and his generals had everything to celebrate. Modern
historians usually call it a ‘reconquest’. But none of the territories
‘reconquered’ had ever previously been ruled from Constantinople. The
shape of Justinian’s new empire on the map looks quite different from any
state that had existed previously. This new ‘Roman’ empire was a maritime
one, unlike the old. It had been achieved by sea, very much as the earliest
expansion of Greek speakers into the western Mediterranean had been more
than a millennium before. For the first time since the heyday of the
Hellenistic kingdoms, the centre of power in the Mediterranean world now
lay in the Greek-speaking east.
In the meantime, on the home front, Justinian had mobilised the empire’s
architects and builders. As soon as peace had been restored after the Nika
riot, the task of rebuilding the centre of the imperial city began. The
destruction offered Justinian the opportunity, and perhaps also the motive,
to build on a scale that had never been seen before. To replace the destroyed
church of Hagia Sophia, he adopted a design that was just then being
pioneered. It was based on a rectangular space with a square at its centre
and topped by a dome. Many centuries would pass before a version of this
form of church architecture would find favour in the West. But it has ever
since remained the basic design of most eastern Orthodox churches in the
Balkans and Russia and would soon be adopted by Muslim architects as the
template for the mosque.
Justinian’s church, the greatest of all the many building projects
commissioned during his reign, was completed in five years—only a third
of the time taken to build the Parthenon in Athens, with which it is often
compared. It was dedicated in December 537, twelve months after

Belisarius’s troops had reclaimed Rome for the empire. For a thousand
years after that, Hagia Sophia would remain the largest religious building
anywhere in the world. Its nave is eighty metres long. The top of its dome
still rises fifty-five metres above the pavements of modern Istanbul. The
creation of two Greek architects from Anatolia, Isidore of Miletus and
Anthemius of Tralles, Hagia Sophia successfully marries the old Greek
science of theoretical geometry to Roman skills of practical engineering.
Light filters into the huge open space through windows placed high under
the dome in such a way as to create a perfectly enclosed world that also
seems capable of encompassing the whole universe, under God’s
overarching heaven.25
Created out of the wreckage caused by the riot of only five years before,
Justinian’s Church of the Holy Wisdom was the visible, monumental proof
of how the Greek-speaking world had changed in the two hundred years
that had passed since the death of Constantine. The triumph of Christianity
was visible for all to see. And the new Greek-speaking empire, with its
capital at Constantinople, was carrying all before it on the battlefield.
Justinian could have been forgiven for believing, as he celebrated his
victories at the end of the 530s, that the words addressed by Eusebius to
Constantine had come true at last:
The image of the higher kingdom is reflected in the emperor who,
beloved of God and in imitation of the Superior Being, by his
governance steers the helm of all the world’s affairs.26
And yet, far away, beyond the serene dome of Hagia Sophia, forces were
already at work whose effects would severely disrupt the cosmic order that
Justinian’s armies and generals, craftsmen and architects seemed to have
created. Even while the great church was reaching towards the sky above
Constantinople, volcanic eruptions in East Asia were hurling vast quantities
of ash and debris into the upper atmosphere. The consequence, in modern
terms, was a ‘dust-veil event’, that caused temporary disruptions to the
climate over large parts of the world. No one alive in Europe or the Middle
East at that time, of course, could have had any inkling of this. Modern
scientists infer it from evidence contained in ancient tree trunks that reveals

changing weather patterns far back in the past. Nomad horsemen from
central Asia, who depended on the ‘delicate grassland ecology’ of that vast
region, burst westwards and southwards towards Europe and the settled
lands of the Middle East. In 539, great numbers of them, called ‘Huns’ by
Procopius, crossed the Danube and broke through the undefended Balkans
to devastate all of mainland Greece north of the Peloponnese. Their raiding
parties even reached close to the walls of Constantinople itself.27
Farther east, and probably from the same environmental cause, the
balance of powers was shifting, too. A new king of Persia, Khusro I, known
in Greek as Chosroes, accused Justinian of being in league with the nomads
who were pressing hard against his own northern flank and aimed a
preemptive strike westward towards the Mediterranean. In 540, a string of
cities in the Greek east was sacked and burned to the ground. At the very
time when Belisarius was accepting the surrender of Ravenna in the west, in
May, the great city of Antioch was razed by Chosroes’s troops and its
people killed, taken into slavery, or forced to flee their homes. Belisarius
had to be brought back hastily from Italy to confront the new threat.
Procopius, recording these events at the time, vividly expressed the
perplexity felt by his contemporaries:
It makes my head spin to write of such suffering.… I cannot understand
what God can possibly be thinking of, to allow a man or a country to
rise to great heights, only to throw them down so soon afterwards and
obliterate them without the slightest visible cause.28
But worse was still to come. It has been suggested that those same
climatic conditions that had brought the nomad horsemen sweeping out of
the steppes may also have affected the rodent population in the regions
bordering the Red Sea, bringing them into closer contact with humans. The
first cases of bubonic plague, probably carried by rat fleas, were recorded
on the Nile delta in 541. By spring the next year, the plague had spread
throughout the Middle East and reached Constantinople. Over the next few
years, it would rampage across all of Europe and the Middle East. In
Constantinople alone, out of a population of some four hundred thousand,
modern estimates put the number of deaths at around 20 to 25 per cent. The

impact on daily life, as recorded by Procopius, resonates uncannily with the
worldwide pandemic of Covid-19 that began in 2020:
No one was to be seen out buying anything. Everyone sat at home, those
who were well enough either caring for the sick or keening for the dead.
All work stopped, craftsmen laid down their crafts, and each person set
aside whatever he was doing.
During a four-month peak in the spring and summer of 542, Procopius tells
us, the plague claimed between five and ten thousand lives each day. The
rational historian can only record, with horror, what he sees:
Some died immediately, others after many days. Those whose bodies
broke out in black pustules, the size of a bean, would not see out the
day, but died in short order. Many began spontaneously to vomit blood
and died soon after.
What especially perplexed Procopius—and again he cannot have been
alone among the sophisticated citizens of Constantinople—was the
‘absence of any cause for the disease that could be grasped by human
reason’. Almost as bewildering was the unpredictability of outcomes.
Doctors were as confounded as everyone else. People survived who had
been given up for dead. Treatment that had seemed to help one patient
might have the opposite effect on another. There was no precaution you
could take, and of course no cure. ‘Suffering would strike without warning;
recovery would happen all by itself’.29
Many saw the affliction in literally apocalyptic terms. The end of the
world and the return of Christ in judgement were at hand. Malalas, a devout
Christian, wrote not long after it was over: ‘The Lord God saw that man’s
transgressions had multiplied and he caused the overthrow of man on the
earth, leading to his destruction in all cities and lands.’ A hymn by the great
religious poet of the age, Romanos the Melodist, like Malalas a Syrian
writing in Greek, sums up a sense of mingled doom and fulfilment that
seems to have been widespread in Constantinople during the latter years of
Justinian’s reign:
The last day is nigh,

Now we behold those things…
Nothing is lacking of which Christ told…: famines and plagues and
frequent earthquakes.
Nation has risen up against nation,
Within all is frightful, without all is filled with strife.30
Even the plague, terrible though it was, brought one unexpected benefit:
the Persians found themselves hit just as hard, and in 545 made peace. This
left Justinian free to turn his attention back to the west. Over the next
decade, his forces went on to conquer the rest of Italy and all the islands of
the western Mediterranean, as well as a slice of the southern coast of Spain
captured from the Visigoths.
In Ravenna, the newly built church of San Vitale was dedicated in 547,
seven years after Belisarius’s triumph over the Ostrogoths. The mosaics
which decorate the apse are among the finest surviving examples of
Christian art of this period. Among them are the side panels that depict
Justinian and Theodora surrounded by elegant courtiers, churchmen, and
ladies-in-waiting. The costumes, particularly of the ladies, are magnificent
and flowing. The empress wears a diadem from which pearls hang down
over her breast; the emperor, a jewelled crown. The heads of both the
imperial figures are surrounded by golden haloes. Much of the background,
too, is made of up glass tesserae coloured by real gold leaf. Curtains swing
and part, a fountain plays. Although the expressions of the faces are
sombre, the background, particularly behind Theodora and her attendants, is
a riot of colour. All this is subordinated to a religious purpose, of course.
The human figures are the servants of Christ, depicted high above them,
and Justinian is holding a bowl of money which may represent his
contribution to the adornment of the building.31 There is no sign, here, of
the apocalyptic gloom that some were expressing in the capital at the very
same time.
Farther afield, during the 540s and 550s, we get glimpses into a wider
world that was still very much open to the future, indeed open for business.
Throughout the Mediterranean, the effect of Justinian’s conquests was to
give a new lease of life to long-distance trade routes that had languished
since the collapse of the empire in the west. In a different direction, Greek-

speaking traders were reaching out from Egyptian ports on the Red Sea into
the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean to reach the coasts of Africa and
India.32
In the 550s, one of these traders wrote a book based, in part, on his
experiences. The main aim of Cosmas Indicopleustes (Sailor-to-India) was
to prove, even against the better-informed scientific opinion of his time, that
the earth was after all flat and that every inhabited part of it conformed to a
divinely ordained pattern derived from the Bible. But Cosmas was also a
curious observer of the places and people he encountered. He had travelled
far outside the Roman Empire and had seen for himself how very much
larger was the world beyond. He had encountered rhinoceroses and giraffes,
though the hippopotamus he knew only from its name and its teeth, which
he had traded. He had seen pepper and coconuts growing. His voyages had
taken him as far as Sri Lanka (called Taprobane in Greek). He demonstrates
the mentality of a truly global trader when he describes that island as being
‘in a central position’—obviously not in relation to his own homeland, still
less its capital city, but rather to a maritime network that reached westwards
to Africa, north to India and Persia, and eastwards to China, which he calls
Tzinitza.
By the time Justinian died in 565, aged over eighty, not only had the
empire expanded in new directions but the world itself had become wider
too. Cosmas the Sailor-to-India may have been badly wrong about the place
of our world in the universe, but his earthly geography was based on
experience and remarkably sound. Cosmas appears to have been the first
writer in Greek to know, at least roughly, where China is and how far
distant. And however wishful his thinking, the confidence of this pious and
presumably not unsuccessful Greek shipowner, writing in the 550s, in the
aftermath of plague, warfare, and natural disasters, would seem to confound
the more dire predictions of imminent doom that were circulating in
Constantinople:
The empire of the Romans thus participates in the dignity of the
Kingdom of the Lord Christ, seeing that it transcends, as far as can be in
this state of existence, every other power, and will remain unconquered
until the final consummation.33

Modern historians frequently dismiss Justinian’s conquests in the west as
a mere flash in the pan. The empire’s dwindling resources had been
disastrously overstretched, so the story goes; the ‘regained’ provinces in the
west could never have been sustainable in the long term. Procopius, writing
in darkly satirical mode during the last years of Justinian’s reign,
foreshadowed that modern interpretation when he caricatured the emperor
and his wife Theodora as ‘blood-thirsty demons’ who had taken on human
form for no other purpose than ‘to find the easiest and swiftest means of
destroying all races of men and all their works’.34 But some modern
historians take a more upbeat view. Most of Justinian’s conquests were still
holding up, come the turn of the next century, and some would last for
much longer. By the year 600, although more ground had recently been lost
in the Balkans, many towns and cities in the east, including Antioch, that
had previously fallen to Persia, had been regained. Yet another peace treaty
with the Sassanids had been concluded as recently as 591.35
The architect of that treaty was a former general by the name of Maurice,
who had become emperor nine years before. At the start of the seventh
century, Maurice led a series of campaigns to win back territory in the
Balkans. By the end of the campaigning season in 602, the troops had had
considerable success. But when the emperor gave the order to keep up the
pressure on the tribesmen during the Balkan winter, this was too much for
the legionaries and they mutinied. The leader of the mutiny, a junior officer
by the name of Phocas, led them towards Constantinople. So far, so
traditional. It was a legacy of the earlier turmoil during the third century
that emperors could be made, and also unmade, by the men they led into
battle. But this was different.
As rumours of the troops’ approach swirled through Constantinople, the
emperor announced a chariot race and everybody poured into the
Hippodrome to watch their favourite champions. It is doubtful whether the
fans of either the Blues or the Greens in the Hippodrome that November
day had any coherent political objective at all. The same probably goes for
the charioteers, though their managers had links to high places and probably
did have an agenda of their own. Maurice’s calculation must have been that
if he could secure the backing of both factions, as Justin had done a century

before, he would have sufficient support in the city to face down the rebel
army.
What followed was in many ways a rerun of the Nika riot. Fighting broke
out in the Hippodrome and then spread through the city. It was not the
soldiers gathered outside the walls who forced Maurice and his immediate
family to flee for their lives, but the populace, whipped up to a frenzy by
the cheerleaders of the rival sporting factions. Order was not restored until
the emperor and four of his five sons had been apprehended and their
severed heads displayed to the crowd in the Hippodrome.36
With the deposition of Maurice, the treaty he had negotiated with the
Persians under Khusro (Chosroes) II came to an end. The eight-year reign
of Phocas saw the start of the last and deadliest of all the wars between
Persia and a European power since the time of Alexander. In its first phase,
it has also been described as a civil war between the army and the civilian
elite within the Roman Empire. We only have one side of the story, but the
accounts that have been preserved all portray Phocas as presiding over a
series of purges, a brutal ruler who never managed to gain legitimacy in the
eyes of his subjects.37
Matters came to a head in 610 when a fleet from the North African
provinces, that had been annexed under Justinian, arrived off
Constantinople. The ringleaders this time seem to have belonged to the
senatorial class. But they must have been efficient at mobilising the
cheerleaders of the Blues and the Greens. While the new emperor,
Heraclius, was receiving his crown, the dismembered corpse of Phocas was
displayed to a baying crowd in the Hippodrome, and the severed head of
one of his advisers was thrown into a public furnace. Others may have been
burnt alive.38
Heraclius’s reign began with a series of disasters. One by one, the great
cities of the east were either sacked by the Persians or surrendered:
Jerusalem, Alexandria, Damascus, Antioch (again). Almost all of the
Balkans had already been overrun by groups of Slavs, Avars, and Bulgars
by the time that Heraclius took charge. Thessalonica, the gateway to
mainland Europe from the Aegean, held out almost alone—thanks to the
massive circuit walls that had been built in the reign of the Theodosius II,
though an anonymous chronicler of the time would give the credit, instead,

to a series of miracles performed by the city’s patron saint, Demetrius.39
Now the decision was taken to abandon the defence of the European
provinces altogether and move all available troops to the eastern front. But
not even this was enough to prevent a Persian expeditionary force from
fighting its way through Anatolia towards the capital in 615. The enemy
pitched camp on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus at a distance from
Constantinople that today is spanned by three suspension bridges. In
desperation, Heraclius made a humiliating offer of peace. If it had been
accepted, it would have turned the Roman state into a Persian vassal. But
Khusro contemptuously rejected the terms and murdered Heraclius’s
ambassadors.
For the next ten years, the fortunes of war went to and fro. For a time, the
Persians were pushed back into Anatolia. Then, in the spring of 622,
Heraclius embarked on a daring plan. Determined to take the fight to the
enemy, he left Constantinople to lead an army in person through the
foothills of the Caucasus in today’s Azerbaijan. The strategy had not yet
proved its worth when a Persian force once again appeared on the Asian
side of the Bosphorus. This time a combined body of Avars and Slavs had
massed on the European side beneath Theodosius’s great walls. It may not
have been by prearrangement among the besieging forces, but
Constantinople was surrounded. And now, if not before, the Persians began
seriously to coordinate their efforts with those of the Slavs and Avars on the
opposite shore. The siege began on 29 July 626 and lasted for ten days. The
Persians had no boats to ferry their infantrymen across. But the Slavs did,
and volunteered their services. The vessels must have been quite small,
because the attackers had apparently carried them overland from the
Danube (the Greek sources contemptuously call them ‘canoes’ or ‘punts’—
monoxyla). So when the Slavs began to ferry the Persian troops across the
Bosphorus, the fleet putting out from Constantinople was able to sink them.
Five days later, the Slavs made another attempt, this time to land their
own men from farther down the coast. But the defenders got wind of the
plan in time and lured the invading boats into an ambush in the narrow
waterway known as the Golden Horn. It was the decisive moment in the
siege. The two attacking forces had been prevented from joining up. Both
had stretched their supply lines to the limit. On the night of 7–8 August

626, the Avars and Slavs set fire to their siege engines and retreated
northwards into the Balkans. The Persians, unable to do anything but watch
from the hills and shore of the Asian side, soon turned tail. Constantinople
had been saved, and with it the Greek-speaking Roman Empire.40
When Themistocles had famously triumphed over the Persian fleet using a
similar tactic in the battle of Salamis in 480 BCE, the experience of
deliverance had inspired the Greek city-states with a new sense of their own
identity and the self-confidence to create the civilisation that we still call
‘classical’. Aeschylus and Herodotus had inaugurated the resonant and
long-running cause of the ‘liberty of Hellas’; Socrates and the philosophers
had championed the power of human reason. Now, in 626, the victory was
attributed to the Virgin Mary, whose icon had been carried round the walls
during the siege. The Church of the Mother of God at Blacherna overlooked
the battle site on the Golden Horn, and she herself, it was said, had
intervened to protect the Christian capital.41 If the aftermath of that first
Persian war had brought out a spirit of unity among Greek speakers as
Greeks, this victory, eleven hundred years later, was bringing them together
as never before in their new identity as Christians.
An unprecedented kind of warfare was developing. Today, we call it ‘holy
war’. The idea was made explicit for the first time when Heraclius launched
his expedition through Transcaucasia to strike at the Persian heartland. On
that occasion, the emperor urged his troops to ‘keep in mind the fear of God
and struggle to avenge insults to Him’. Once upon a time, Greek city-states
had fought to avenge damage and destruction to the citizen body, to
cherished public buildings and sacred temples. But Heraclius’s enemies
were the enemies of God himself. And however great the odds, the troops
could rest assured that ‘Our danger is not without reward but is the
harbinger of eternal life’.42
It was a risky venture. But it worked. Less than two years after the siege
of Constantinople had been lifted, Heraclius entered Persia from the north
and the Sassanid Empire imploded. Chosroes was murdered by his own side
early in 628. The whole of the Middle East, up to the River Tigris, was
returned to Roman rule. So was Egypt, which for centuries had provided
most of the grain that had once fed the people of Rome and until recently
had done the same for Constantinople. For a few short months, it even

looked as though the next king of Persia would become a Christian and be
baptised with a Greek name. It would have been the ultimate vindication for
a political state that now defined itself by the religious faith of its citizens.
According to the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, God had created
the world in six days and rested on the seventh. In the same way, it was said
at the time, Heraclius had laboured for six years on campaign. In the
seventh, he returned to his capital—to commemorate his victory not with
the parade of strength and riches that had marked a traditional Roman
triumph but rather with a ‘mystic celebration’, presumably under the
heavenly dome of Hagia Sophia.43
Shortly afterwards, Heraclius set out for Jerusalem. Part of the ‘True
Cross’, on which Jesus had supposedly been crucified, had been venerated
as a relic in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre there, ever since it had come
to light three centuries earlier. When the Persians sacked the city in 614,
they had taken the prized relic back with them to Ctesiphon, their capital on
the Tigris. Now, with the terms of peace, it had been returned. Heraclius
determined that he would be there in person to oversee its formal
restoration to its rightful place and in this way to mark the symbolic
triumph not of Roman arms but of the Roman faith.
But first, before he left Constantinople in 629, Heraclius adopted a new
imperial title. His predecessors had always styled themselves, in the Roman
manner, either ‘emperor’ or ‘Augustus’ (Sebastos in Greek). In their Greek
forms, these titles would have many centuries of life left in them yet. But
alongside them, Heraclius became the first ruler of a ‘Roman’ empire to
revive the long-disused Greek word for ‘king’, basileus.44 From then on,
this would remain the official title, in Greek, of every ruler to rule from
Constantinople, even after Christian emperors had been replaced by
Ottoman sultans, until the end of the eighteenth century.
The significance of this is not just religious. It is often pointed out that
basileus had been the title of King David in the Greek version of the Old
Testament, and Jerusalem had been his royal city. But for a far longer
period, basileus had been the title of the ancient Macedonian kings and of
the Hellenistic dynasties that had come after them. In styling himself
‘faithful Basileus in Christ’, Heraclius at a stroke redefined the empire over
which he ruled: as the inheritor not only of God’s chosen kingdom but also

of the great Hellenistic kingdoms that had preceded the power of Rome.
What had once been a pagan empire was now to be a Christian kingdom,
defined by faith and (although the second was only implicit) by the Greek
language.
When Heraclius entered Jerusalem on 21 March 630, at the head of a
solemn procession, and carried the fragment of the True Cross to the church
that had been built over the site of Jesus’s crucifixion, it must have seemed
to many of those present that something momentous had been fulfilled.
Among the many prophecies about the end of the world that were in
circulation by this time was one that imagined the last emperor of the
Romans, or according to another version, ‘King of the Greeks’, setting up
the Holy Cross on the site of the crucifixion, placing his crown on top of it,
and ‘hand[ing] over the kingship to God the Father’. These events would be
a sure sign that the Second Coming of Christ, the Last Judgement, and the
Kingdom of Heaven were at hand.45
Needless to say, Heraclius did not lay down his crown in Jerusalem and
the world did not end. But with the change of royal title, in a sense
Heraclius was the last emperor to rule over the people who still called
themselves ‘Romans’. In hindsight, we can see that an era really was about
to end, though not even the most apocalyptic of prophets could have
imagined how. During the three hundred years since the inauguration of
Constantinople, the Roman Empire had been transformed. Greek speakers
had reinvented themselves once more, this time as Christian Romans. Their
state was once again ruled by a basileus. And the city that Constantine had
founded, now nicknamed the ‘second Rome’ or ‘new Rome’, had first
eclipsed and then replaced the old one in the geopolitics of the
Mediterranean and the Middle East.46

‘THE EYES OF THE UNIVERSE’
630–1018

H

eraclius may have invented holy war, but it was the Arab successors of

the prophet Muhammad who perfected it and for the first time gave it a
name: jihad. The emperor had not long been back in Constantinople when
far to the south, beyond the limits of his rule, Muhammad died in June 632.
For the past ten years, this charismatic leader had been uniting the tribes of
Arabia in the name of a new monotheistic religion: Islam. Beginning in
635, a Muslim army led by Muhammad’s successor, Caliph Omar, swept
through the entire region. Damascus was the first city to fall. The next year,
an army sent out from Constantinople was decisively beaten at the point
where the gorge of the River Yarmuk emerges into the plain of Galilee
beneath the Golan Heights—today at the meeting point, and closed borders,
of Jordan, Israel, and Syria. By 638, Jerusalem had a new master and was
about to become a holy city of Islam, as well as of Judaism and Christianity.
Heraclius’s hard-won victory over the Persians had proved, in so short a
time, to have been the most hollow of triumphs. Modern historians have
concluded that the age-old adversaries of the ancient world had fought
themselves to a state of exhaustion. Both had become so weakened as to
create a power vacuum throughout the Middle East. The Arabs simply
seized their moment. Heraclius died in 641, just as news reached
Constantinople that Caesarea, on the Mediterranean coast, had been taken.
Alexandria was next. Within five years, all of Egypt was in Muslim hands.
The once-mighty Persian Empire fared no better. By the start of the next
decade, the whole of Persia had submitted to Arab rule. The three-hundred-

year-old Sassanid dynasty was at an end. The entire Middle East became
the Muslim Caliphate, ruled from its new capital in Damascus.

Constantinople had lost ground before and bounced back. But this time,
the changes would prove permanent. Islam had come to stay. So had the
Arabic language, which eventually would take the place of Greek in all the
conquered Roman provinces. Along with more than half the empire’s
territory had gone the manpower, the tax revenues, and the greater part of
the food supplies that had sustained its cities and their institutions for
centuries. The remaining Greek-speaking heartland, in Anatolia, was now
open to Arab raids from the south and east. Renewed outbreaks of plague
would sweep through the region, roughly once in each decade. Under these
continued onslaughts, cities that for centuries had been rich and populous
shrank to a fraction of their former size. This was the case with Ephesus,
where the Temple of Artemis had been counted as one of the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World, Pergamum, Ancyra (modern Ankara),
Aphrodisias, and dozens more. Less well-known cities and smaller towns
throughout Anatolia were abandoned altogether as the surviving population
moved to smaller, defensible sites.1
In the Balkans the situation was even worse. Settlement by speakers of a
Slavonic language seems to have begun in earnest in the southern Balkans
during the 570s and 580s. While the nomadic Avars had been briefly
powerful enough to mobilise the local Slavs and mount a full-scale assault
on Constantinople in 626, they would disappear from the historical record
soon afterwards. But the Slavs would remain, even if at first their
communities were small and widely scattered. The Slavs were never an
organised force at this time, rather a symptom of the fragmentation that was
taking place. Then in the 680s a new group of Turkic-speaking Bulgars
established their own state, the distant ancestor of today’s Bulgaria, more or
less on Constantinople’s northern doorstep.
In most of what is now Greece, urban life all but disappeared during the
seventh century. Thessalonica continued to hold out within its massive
walls, a mere outpost reachable from Constantinople only by sea. Farther
south, most of the great cities of classical times shared the fate of their
counterparts in Anatolia. Athens somehow limped on as little more than a
provincial town huddled at the foot of the Acropolis. Even in
Constantinople, by the year 700 the population may have fallen from its
peak of around four hundred thousand to just forty thousand. If that

estimate is anywhere near correct, it matches the drop in population in
southwest Greece after the Mycenaean palace of Pylos had burned down
almost two millennia before, heralding a ‘dark age’ of several centuries.2
This period, too, is often described as another such dark age. Theophylact
Simocattes, the last of the historians writing in the tradition of Herodotus
and Thucydides, fell silent shortly after 630. The historical record does not
pick up again until a monk by the name of Theophanes completed his
Chronicle shortly before his own death in 818. No one any more was asking
the kind of question that Procopius had asked about the causes and effects
of the plague back in the time of Justinian. When everything is falling apart
around you, you either concentrate on the immediate needs of survival—or
you turn to faith in a better life beyond this one. That is what Greek writers
did during those years, and indeed for long afterwards. Almost all that they
wrote is devoted to religious topics, including hymns, the lives of saints,
and the continuing disputes about Christian doctrine.3
Historians since the nineteenth century have become accustomed to label
the civilisation that emerged at this time as ‘Byzantium’ and its people as
‘Byzantines’. In the language of today, the Greek-speaking Roman Empire
after the death of Heraclius in 641 had turned into the Byzantine. Out of this
process a new Greek civilisation was emerging. From this point on, we, too,
must bow to modern usage and call the people who created this new
civilisation Byzantines—even though they themselves never did, and their
descendants would continue to think of themselves as Romans for more
than a millennium to come.4
Throughout the second half of the seventh century and well into the next,
successive Arab caliphs kept up the pressure on the Byzantine Empire. In
653, once again an enemy force pitched camp on the Asian shore of the
Bosphorus. By this time, the Arabs had built a war fleet and launched it into
the Mediterranean. Early the next year, their land forces facing
Constantinople were joined by the first hostile navy to appear in the Sea of
Marmara since long before the city had been founded. The threat was even
greater than it had been in 626 because the attackers were able to move by
sea as well as by land. This time it really was only an ‘act of God’ that
saved the day. While the emperor ‘stripped off his purple [robes], put on

sackcloth, sat on ashes, and ordered a fast to be proclaimed’, a sudden
storm blew up and destroyed the enemy fleet. Without transport across the
water, once again the attacking force was powerless and had to withdraw. A
little over a decade later, they would be back. This time a new siege lasted
for two years, from 667 to 669, with blockades in the Sea of Marmara
continuing until 678.5
By 700, the Byzantines had been forced back upon the western regions of
what is now Turkey, together with their capital and its immediate hinterland
on the southeastern tip of Europe. Beyond that core, Constantinople still
controlled scattered islands and strips of coastline in the Aegean, several
pockets of the Italian mainland, including Ravenna on the Adriatic coast,
and Sicily. It was on the last of these that the citizens of the capital had
come to rely for their food supply (a further justification, in hindsight, for
Justinian’s war of ‘reconquest’ almost two centuries before). Once again,
ships and the sea were proving to be the main lifeline for Greek speakers.
Added together, these scattered territories barely made up a viable state, let
alone an empire. Only one thing held them together, and that was the
imperial city, with its centralised institutions. The key to survival would be
Constantinople.6
As Muslim forces advanced ever closer to the Bosphorus, emperors came
and went with increasing rapidity. Most of these were military men, raised
to the highest office by their fellow commanders and deposed again by the
same means. Between 711 and 717 no fewer than five emperors held the
imperial throne. Given little time to prove his worth while in office, a
deposed ruler would be lucky to be allowed to retire to the obscurity of a
monastery. Justinian II and his son were murdered in 711, Philippikos, who
had ousted him, was blinded two years later—a new and effective way of
ensuring that there could be no comeback. In such extreme circumstances,
even loyalty could become expendable. In 716, Anastasios II appealed to
the approaching Arab commander for help against the latest usurper in
Constantinople, though the appeal received short shrift. This was collapse
from within and from the top.
In March 717, after yet another rebellion in the military, the commander
of the eastern division was crowned in Hagia Sophia with the imperial title
of Leo III. The third and final Arab siege of Constantinople began five

months later, on 15 August. Arab warships crowded into the strait of the
Bosphorus. The following spring, a new fleet of transports from Egypt
landed troops on the European shore. The city was surrounded, by land and
sea.
We have no eyewitness account of the siege. It lasted for a whole year.
Leo seems to have been an astute tactician and made the best use he could
of his limited resources. His predecessors had prudently concluded an
alliance with the Bulgar kingdom to the north. That meant there would no
repeat of the siege of almost a century before, when the Persians on one
side of the Bosphorus had come so close to linking up with the Avars and
Slavs on the other. Bulgar troops even joined with the Byzantines in
mounting counterattacks against the enemy. And the defenders had a secret
weapon. It had been invented, probably in the 660s, by a Greek called
Kallinikos, from Arab-controlled Syria. Westerners would later call it
‘Greek fire’, but in Greek it was known as ‘liquid fire’. It seems to have
been an early form of artillery. A lighted petroleum-based liquid was
projected from a tube, to burn on the surface of the water and engulf an
enemy ship. Its effects on the Arab fleet proved deadly—and the secret
would be so well kept, down the centuries, that even today no one knows
for sure how it worked.7
After a year, it was the besiegers, not the besieged, who were starving. If
Theophanes, writing almost a century later, is to be believed, the Arabs
were reduced to eating their own faeces and the corpses of their comrades.
Whether or not that was the cause, it does seem to be true that their ranks
were decimated by disease. By August 718, a new caliph had come to
power in Damascus and ordered his forces to withdraw. For centuries
thereafter, in Muslim histories, the failure to take Constantinople in 718
would be reckoned as one of the greatest defeats for the forces of Islam.
Muslim leaders from that time on would have to come to terms with the
existence of the Byzantine Empire, which they continued to call ‘Rome’
(Rum in Arabic). It would not be until the coming of the Ottoman Turks, in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, that a Muslim army would once again
set its sights on the ‘city of the world’s desire’.8

By the first half of the eighth century, the geopolitics of the entire western
part of the Eurasian landmass had been transformed. From the Atlantic to
the Hindu Kush, from the edge of the Sahara Desert to the Arctic Circle, the
overriding division among the human population was no longer between
east and west but between north and south. And for the first time in history,
it was not a division between competing states (or between a centralised
state and the absence of one beyond its borders) but between competing
religions. On one side stood Islam, on the other an entity that had no single
political existence but that now came to be known as Christendom.9
To the south of an arc drawn through the Mediterranean and extending to
the Pyrenees in one direction and the Caucasus in the other, Islam was the
official religion and Arabic the dominant language. For the time being, all
political power across this vast region lay with the Arab Caliphate. North of
that line, wherever Rome had once ruled and where Constantinople still did,
Christianity was by now all but universal. The only exceptions were regions
where incoming ‘barbarian’ peoples had settled in large numbers and had
yet to be converted. This was the case at opposite ends of Europe: in the
British Isles and in much of the Balkans, including large parts of today’s
Greece. On the Christian side of the line, the long-standing division
between a Latin-speaking west and a Greek-speaking east was now more
marked than ever. Knowledge of Greek had disappeared from the west,
knowledge of Latin from the east. In the west, Latin would continue to be
the written language of western kingdoms for several centuries yet and
remains to this day the official language of the Roman Catholic Church.
East of the old line of division and allowing for intrusions by Slavonic and
Arabic in particular regions, the equivalent language remained Greek—with
the difference that, unlike Latin, Greek would also continue as the spoken
language of the majority.
In the western part of Christendom, in the absence of any political centre
of power, the bishops of Rome had already begun to acquire a spiritual
authority that would not be seriously challenged until the sixteenth century.
In Byzantium, on the other hand, the special status of the Pope, the official
title of the bishop of Rome, was never recognised. There, because the
political role of the emperor continued without a break, the highest
ecclesiastical authority would remain the Patriarch of Constantinople, who

was usually an imperial appointee. It was probably inevitable, given such
fundamental differences, that sooner or later the two halves of Christendom
would come into conflict, even while both fought to resist the expansion of
Islam on their borders and to reverse it when they could.
After 718, the enemy had retreated from beneath the walls of
Constantinople, but Arab raids deep into central Anatolia would continue
for several decades. It was not until 740, the last full year of the reign of
Leo III, that a Byzantine army scored a decisive victory, and the tide began
to turn.10 During this time, the forces of the Caliphate were not the only
existential threat, as Byzantium struggled to reassert itself. In the summer of
726, the subterranean volcano beneath the caldera of Thera exploded in
what was probably the largest eruption since the one that had buried the
Bronze Age town of Akrotiri more than two millennia earlier. Smoke, ‘as if
from a burning oven, arose from the depths of the sea,’ wrote the chronicler
Theophanes, who had not yet been born at the time. Out of the ‘fiery
combustion’, ‘great lumps of pumice like hilltops’ were projected high into
the air and fell on coasts hundreds of miles away. The ‘whole face of the
sea’ was covered with floating pumice. By the time the eruption subsided, a
new island had emerged from the seabed inside the caldera.
Other natural disasters followed. In 741, Constantinople was rocked by a
severe earthquake. Churches and fortifications were damaged throughout
Anatolia. Tsunamis swept the Aegean. Shortly afterwards, in 747, came
another outbreak of plague. This was the worst since the first one, that had
been described so vividly by Procopius, two hundred years before. The
dead were piled high in makeshift wagons. Orchard gardens within the city
walls were dug up to bury them. But there was not enough ground; corpses
ended up in wells and cisterns, which can hardly have been good for public
hygiene. After this, as it turned out, the plague would not come again until
the Black Death of the fourteenth century. But, of course, no one was to
know that at the time.11
Modern societies and governments, faced with threats like these, turn to
‘experts’—technologists and scientists. The experts who were in greatest
demand in Byzantium in the eighth century were theologians. Christianity
was now so deeply embedded that imperceptibly, in public consciousness, it
had taken on something of the mantle of the old religion that it had

replaced. Once upon a time, in the Greek-speaking world, success in war
and protection from unpredictable forces of nature had depended on
propitiating the gods. Ever since Heraclius had successfully mobilised his
troops in a holy war against an enemy of unbelievers, that role had become
attached to the Christian God. But there was a vital difference. If the whole
universe was ruled by a single, all-powerful God, you had only the one
chance to get it right. Constantinople had been saved in 718, but only just.
What was it about the Muslim Arabs that made God seem to favour them
and not the Christian ‘Romans’? If emperors and their subjects were being
punished with pestilence, fire, and earthquakes, what could they possibly be
doing wrong?12 So began a controversy that would occupy the best minds
and the highest authorities of the Byzantine church and state for almost a
century and a half and remains today one of the most lasting legacies of
Byzantium to the modern world.
Today we call this controversy ‘iconoclasm’, which is Greek for ‘breaking
images’. The Byzantines themselves called it, more accurately,
eikonomachia, or ‘iconomachy’, which means ‘battle over images’.13 Much
of the detail of what happened remains obscure and has been hotly debated
by historians since the eighteenth century. All we can be sure of is that
during two periods, totalling a little over sixty years, from 754 to 787 and
from 815 to 843, it was forbidden throughout the empire to produce or to
display images of Christ, the Virgin Mary, angels, or saints in human form.
To do so, it was declared at a Church Council held in 754, was to violate the
commandment in the Old Testament against worshipping ‘idols’ or ‘graven
images’. The iconoclasts, as the champions of the change became known,
had noticed that their Muslim enemies interpreted the same sacred text in
this way, as indeed has been the practice in Islam ever since. Just as
mosques contain no representations of human figures, so it was decided that
Christian churches could be decorated only with the symbol of the cross.
Anything else would be blasphemy and offensive to God. Unwittingly, the
Christian empire had strayed into the sin of idolatry. No wonder its people
were being punished.
This radical new policy provoked the first serious disagreement between
the churches of Constantinople and Rome—since the western church saw

no problem and pointedly refused to sign up either to iconoclasm or to the
eventual solution that would be found to replace it. It is hard to tell how
much artwork was actually destroyed. Examples have been found of
mosaics in which the telltale signs of alteration can still be seen, with glass
tesserae removed and replaced by others in the approved design—though
this may not have happened as frequently as used to be thought. After it was
over, lurid stories began to circulate in Greek about wanton desecration of
holy pictures and the persecution, even martyrdom, inflicted on priests and
monks who had stood up in their defence.14
The ebb and flow of the controversy can be mapped fairly precisely onto
the fortunes of military campaigns to secure and stabilise the borders of the
Byzantine state. Revival had begun in the last years of the reign of Leo III,
who would later be remembered (probably wrongly) as an instigator of
iconoclasm. It went much further under his son, Constantine V. During a
reign that lasted from 741 to 775, Constantine made military gains in the
east and in the Balkans, against Slavs and a now hostile Bulgar kingdom.
Even his later detractors had to give Constantine the credit for restoring the
water supply to Constantinople by repairing the fourth-century aqueduct
(part of which still stands near the centre of Istanbul) that had been out of
commission since the siege of 626. These are indications that the city’s
population was once again on the rise, and resources were becoming
available again for public works. When the first period of iconoclasm
ended, in 787, the Byzantine throne was occupied by an empress, Irene,
who held it as regent for her young son, Constantine VI. Irene’s reasons for
reversing the policy on images have been much debated. Probably they
were more political than religious. The empress may have seen it as a
priority to patch up relations with the Church of Rome in the west.15
Irene went on to become the first woman to rule the Byzantine Empire in
her own right after her son plotted against her and she had him blinded. But
the experiment did not last long. In 802, she was ousted in a bloodless coup
organised by her senior ministers and died shortly afterwards in internal
exile. The new emperor was Nikephoros I, a former treasury official.
Nikephoros seems to have been the architect of a far-reaching reform of
taxation and military organisation known as the ‘theme’ system. This
created incentives for local communities to take responsibility for their own

defence, while saving precious resources for the central treasury. The logic
behind the reform was surely defensive, and it would stand the Byzantine
state in good stead for at least the next two centuries.
Not content with the defence of his realm, Nikephoros also went on the
offensive. A series of campaigns during the first decade of the ninth century
brought much of today’s Greece back under Byzantine control. By
extending the theme system into the Greek mainland, Nikephoros ensured
that the pagan, Slavonic-speaking communities, that had been scattered
throughout the region for several centuries, would quickly be assimilated to
become Christian, Greek-speaking ‘Romans’. The emperor’s name means
‘Victory-Bearer’. But Nikephoros’s run of victories was brutally cut short
when he was killed in battle against the Bulgars in 811, and his skull
allegedly used as a drinking cup by the Bulgar king.16
Two years later, another usurper, Leo V, needed urgently to consolidate
his grip on the throne. The ‘breaking of images’ was back on the agenda.
After the disaster at the hands of the Bulgars, the new emperor was not the
only one to look back with nostalgic admiration at what had been achieved
during the reign of the iconoclast Constantine V. Surely, God could not,
after all, favour religious images and was punishing the empire
accordingly? So a new Church Council, in 815, reversed the previous
reversal. Images were prohibited for a second time.17
But a quarter of a century later, as the reign of the emperor Theophilos
was coming to an end, evidence for divine favour was becoming harder and
harder to find. Crete had been lost to Arab raiders from Spain in 827. The
Arabs had begun their conquest of Sicily at the same time; inexorably, year
by year, more ground was being lost there. What remained of Byzantine
control in the southern Italian mainland was being whittled away. In 838, on
land, an Arab army advanced far enough into Anatolia to sack Amorion,
near today’s Afyonkarahisar in western Turkey. When Theophilos died in
January 842, once again an empress, Theodora, held the throne as regent for
their young son. This time, too, the motives behind what happened next
have been much debated. The outcome was that, after yet another Church
Council, on the first Sunday of Lent, 4 March 843, a solemn procession
made its way to Hagia Sophia to celebrate what has ever since been

commemorated as the ‘Triumph of Orthodoxy’. Iconoclasm was over, this
time for good.
In a later icon which represents the scene, the painted image of the Virgin
and Child has pride of place, with the holy figures represented to a slightly
larger scale than the worshippers below them. The experiment of banning
religious images had spectacularly backfired. If some among the theological
‘experts’ had thought the way to win God’s favour was to ape the rival
Muslims, the latest gathering of bishops had resolved that the Christian
state of Byzantium was going to be as different from them as possible. After
this, the face of Christ would be displayed on every imperial coin minted.18
Every interior space in a Byzantine church would be covered with frescoes
depicting holy figures and scenes from the Old and New Testaments. High
above all would float the severe figure of Christ Pantokrator (Almighty)
looking down from the central dome. The Greek word meaning ‘image’
(eikon or icon) came to be particularly attached to portable images of the
saints that could be carried in procession and would be routinely kissed by
the faithful on entering church.
A careful theological distinction had been devised to explain that the
‘veneration’ of images was not the same as worship, or idolatry. Under the
firm guidance and control of the ecclesiastical authorities, sacred images
were recognised as a precious channel of communication between the
worshipper and the divine. ‘Holy images’ were ‘the eyes of the universe’, in
the memorable words of the Patriarch Photios, the most learned man of his
day, preaching in Hagia Sophia on Easter Saturday 867. And in the
presence of the reigning emperor and his heir apparent, Photios called on
God himself to:
protect [such images] like the pupil of an eye, keep them above any evil,
make them seem terrible to their foes and keep them, as well as us,
worthy of you and your endless and blessed kingdom.19
As the dangers to Byzantium and its citizens receded, so had the spectre
of God’s displeasure. ‘Roman Christians’ could now take comfort, as their
patriarch also assured them, in the knowledge that they were the divinely
Chosen People, as the Israelites of the Old Testament had once been.20 Like
the ancient Israelites, they might still be punished for their misdeeds. But

once chosen, they could no longer be cast off entirely, as many must really
have feared might happen to them while they endured the shocks of the first
half of the eighth century.
With the end of iconoclasm, the Byzantine state had defined itself anew.
But it was entirely characteristic of the novel way of thinking that no
Byzantine, either then or later, would ever willingly admit just how new it
really was. The Triumph of Orthodoxy was celebrated, and is still
commemorated by the Orthodox Church today, as the vindication of beliefs
and practices that supposedly go back to the very dawn of Christianity.
Every Byzantine writer who refers to the controversy describes its
conclusion as a ‘restoration’; the attempt to suppress religious images had
been that most heinous of things, an ‘innovation’. But the theology that
gave a special place to religious images as intermediaries between the
human and the divine was not traditional at all. Challenged and honed by
the intervening bouts of iconoclasm, it had been worked out in
Constantinople over the two centuries that had passed since the start of the
Arab conquests.21
Until the end of the battle over images, most emperors had been content to
follow a policy that has been labelled ‘defensive imperialism’. Nikephoros I
had been the exception; his fate, if anything, only reinforced the general
rule. Throughout this time, the overriding priority of successive emperors
was to consolidate within existing borders rather than to expand the state
and lord it over others. Indeed, it has been argued that this was always the
default option for the Byzantines and that they were not warlike by
nature.22 Ever since the parting of the ways between the eastern and
western empires at the end of the fourth century, the bureaucracy in
Constantinople had developed its own distinctive approach to handling
outsiders and rival powers—not by war but by diplomatic means.
Diplomacy had never been a strong point for the ancient Greeks; Rome,
throughout its heyday, had been blunt in its dealings with outsiders. But the
eastern empire, during its transition from Roman to Byzantine, had been
well served by the subtle patience of its diplomats. At the heart of
Byzantine diplomacy lay an assumption of innate superiority. The trick was
to persuade foreign rulers that the emperor possessed riches and powers

such as they could only ever dream of; in return for services to the
Byzantine state, a token portion could be theirs. And for many centuries, it
worked. More often than not, the inducement would take the form of
official titles. These cost nothing to grant and no doubt sounded grand in the
foreign languages of the recipients. More crudely, whenever the imperial
treasury could afford it, potential enemies were simply bought off. In the
most favoured cases—and in later centuries routinely—a marriage alliance
into the imperial family might be brokered.23
Elaborate rituals were devised to impress ambassadors or princes from
abroad. A manual of ceremonial practice, dating from the tenth century,
describes the intricate hierarchy and dazzling spectacle of the Byzantine
court that would be on display. Visitors would be cowed by the emperor’s
apparent power to command even nature, seated upon a golden throne that
could be raised up into the air, while mechanical lions roared and
mechanical birds sang.24 It was no doubt because the Byzantines managed
to flatter and bamboozle outsiders for so long that the adjective ‘Byzantine’
would acquire the connotations that it has today: of deviousness and
bureaucratic impenetrability.
By the middle of the ninth century, ambassadors were being dispatched
from Constantinople to states and kingdoms across vast distances, in every
direction. To the east they had extensive dealings with the Chazars, who
controlled much of central Asia, and farther south, with the Arab Caliphate,
first in Damascus and later in Baghdad. The first embassy from Byzantium
may have reached China as early as the mid-seventh century; in later
Chinese accounts, Constantinople was called ‘Fu-lin’, equivalent to the
familiar Greek abbreviation Polis or Poli (‘City’). In the opposite direction,
Byzantine missions negotiated with popes in Rome and even, after some
reluctance, with the German king of the Franks, known to history as
Charlemagne, who on Christmas Day in the year 800 had been crowned by
the pope to rule over a rival Roman empire in the west.25
In the case of the Slavs, the diplomatic offer took an unusual form, which
is still with us today. Methodios and his younger brother Constantine grew
up in Thessalonica, where their father was serving as a senior army officer.
There, they learned to speak the language of the Slav settlements that
surrounded the city. The linguistic talents of the pair were recognised early.

While Methodios gained advancement through the church, Constantine was
taken to Constantinople to receive the highest level of education available
in his day. Before long, he was undertaking diplomatic missions to central
Asia. In the 860s, when the Patriarch Photios devised a new mission to
convert the Slavs of central Europe to Christianity and bring them into the
orbit of Constantinople, he called upon the brothers for the task.
Constantine devised a modified form of the Greek alphabet, that for the first
time made it possible to write in Slavonic. Methodios went on to translate
the Bible into this newly written language.
Even though the original mission failed, its longer-term consequence
would be to convert most of the Slavonic-speaking populations of the
Balkans, as well as the ancestors of today’s Russians and of many
Ukrainians, to the eastern, Orthodox form of Christianity. The modern
states formed by the descendants of these peoples still use the alphabet
devised for the mission and named ‘Cyrillic’ after Cyril, the monastic name
taken by Constantine after he became a monk in his last years. The
conversion of all these previously pagan peoples was another achievement
of patient diplomacy and ingenious innovation. This was in marked contrast
to the wars of conquest that had brought about the spread of Islam in the
seventh century or the practice of western rulers such as Charlemagne, who
had imposed Christianity on the peoples of today’s Germany at the point of
the sword in the last years of the eighth.26
But soft power had its limits. Byzantines were soldiers, too. And they still
maintained a formidable navy, even if by the middle of the ninth century
they had lost control of most of the Mediterranean except for the Aegean
and the Adriatic. With the battle over images finally resolved and the
Abbasid Caliphate in disarray, it would soon be time to match soft power
with hard. The first signs of a decisive turn of the tide came with the arrival
of a new emperor, and a new, unusually long-lasting dynasty, on the
Byzantine throne.
The emperor and heir apparent who had been present in Hagia Sophia on
that Easter Saturday in 867, when Photios delivered his sermon about holy
images, were Michael III and Basil I. It was quite usual, by this time, for a
reigning emperor to appoint his successor in his lifetime. The designated

heir would share the imperial title but have no power or authority of his
own. Normally, this would be a son or another close family member. But
Michael had no legitimate children. Instead, he had chosen to elevate an
older man to this coveted role. If, as seems probable, there was a sexual
element to the relationship, this would have been strictly taboo in Christian
Byzantium and would have had to be concealed.
Basil had risen from obscurity on the strength of his exceptional physique
and his prowess at taming horses. Six months after that sermon in Hagia
Sophia, the relationship had soured. Michael was apt to drink himself into a
stupor. His public reputation was beginning to suffer as a result. And
Michael could see that Basil was poised to take advantage of his role as heir
apparent. By September 867, each was plotting to murder the other. Basil
got in first. While the emperor was in his cups, Basil opened the imperial
bedchamber to a gang of assassins who first hacked off Michael’s hands,
then stabbed him fatally in the back.27
Under Basil’s rule, the Byzantine state began to expand once again. Its
fleet regained control of the Adriatic and the southern Italian coasts.
Although the Muslim hold on Sicily would prove too strong to break, the
whole of the Italian mainland south of Naples was regained by the 880s.
Two new military districts, or ‘themes’, were created in Italy and would last
for close on two hundred years. The origins of the Greek-speaking
communities that still exist in Calabria and Puglia are thought to lie in this
period of Byzantine reconquest. At the same time, Byzantine land forces
pushed farther east in Anatolia than they had been able to penetrate for
more than a century. After Basil died in 886, his successors held on to the
gains that had been made in the west and continued to push the bounds of
the realm outwards in all the other directions of the compass.
To the south, beyond the Aegean, Crete was recaptured in 961. Four years
later, Cyprus, which had been jointly administered with the Arabs for
almost three centuries, became fully a ‘Roman’ possession once more.
Byzantine armies had been reaching from Anatolia into Syria since the
930s. Antioch and Aleppo were regained in 969; once again the eastern
frontier was pushed back to the old Roman line of the Euphrates. To the
northeast, beyond the Black Sea, Georgia and much of Armenia were
brought within the imperial fold, through a combination of hard and soft

power that would continue to yield dividends into the 1060s. These lands
were largely Christian, but their peoples spoke their own languages, as their
descendants still do today (and Armenians were spread out across a much
wider area than the republic that now bears their name).
It was to the north, and closest to their own doorstep, that the Byzantines
experienced the greatest difficulties. The Rus, centred on the city of Kiev
and the political forerunners of both modern Russia and Ukraine, would
never accept Byzantine rule, even though their ruler Vladimir embraced
Orthodox Christianity in 989. Neither would the Bulgars, whose kingdom
had long since moved on from being a pliant ally during the last Arab siege
of Constantinople. The original founders of the Bulgar state had been
Turkic nomads from central Asia. But by the time of their greatest
confrontation with Byzantium in the early eleventh century, the ruling
Bulgars had long since adopted the Slavonic language of the majority. They,
too, were now Christians and, like the Rus, celebrated the Orthodox liturgy
using the Slavonic translation of the Bible by Methodios and the Cyrillic
alphabet that had been devised for the purpose by his brother.
Basil II, whose reign from 976 to 1025 was the longest in all Byzantine
history, made it his mission to conquer the independent Bulgar kingdom
and bring its Slavonic-speaking people within the Byzantine fold. The
campaign seems to have lasted, on and off, for almost twenty years. The
decisive battle took place in 1014, in a narrow pass called Kleidion, today
close to the meeting point of the borders of Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and
Greece. After his victory, later historians would claim that Basil had
ordered some fifteen thousand Bulgar captives to be blinded and sent back
to their king in batches of a hundred, each led by an officer who had been
spared the sight of a single eye for the purpose. When Tsar Samuel of
Bulgaria saw his troops returning in this condition, the story goes on, he
was himself struck blind and died of grief shortly afterwards. The truth of
this horrific tale has been questioned. But, with or without this added
atrocity, Basil’s victory earned him the bloodthirsty title of Boulgaroktonos
—the Bulgar Slayer—by which he has been known in Greek ever since. By
1018, four years after the battle, the whole of the Balkans, to the south and
west of the Danube, had been brought back under ‘Roman’ rule—

something that for many of these regions had not been the case for five
centuries or more.28
To celebrate this achievement, Basil II did something that no other
emperor of Byzantium had done before or ever would again. He led his
entourage on a long detour south to Athens. The depleted city had been a
backwater for hundreds of years; it had no political or strategic importance
to the empire. But the fifteen-hundred-year-old Parthenon, that the
Athenians had dedicated to the patron goddess of their city, Athena
Parthenos (the Virgin), had long ago been converted to a Christian church
and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Since the settlement of the controversy
over religious images two centuries before Basil’s time, the interior walls
would have been densely painted with images of the Virgin, Christ, and
other holy figures. This was the setting that the emperor chose for his act of
public ‘thanksgiving for his victory to the Mother of God’, whose church he
also endowed with precious gifts.29 Once upon a time, the Athenian
democracy, led by Pericles, had given thanks to the virgin protectress of the
city for victory over the Persians, and the roof-high gold and ivory statue of
Athena had dwarfed the viewer. Now a very different kind of Greekspeaking ruler made his devotions and gave his thanks to a different divine
virgin for victory over a different enemy beneath the gaze of the ‘eyes of
the universe’.

‘CITY OF THE WORLD’S DESIRE’
1018–1204

T

he medieval state that we call Byzantium was very close to the height of

its power and extent when Basil II died in 1025. Only a few short-lived
gains still remained to be made, in eastern Anatolia and in Sicily, over the
next forty years. Constantinople was now the largest and richest city in
Europe, quite possibly in the entire world. Its population may once again
have reached four hundred thousand, a level not seen since the onslaught of
plague during the reign of Justinian, in 542. Controlling the land routes that
led across Asia to China, emperors and their officials were enriched by the
proceeds of worldwide trade. A Jewish visitor from Muslim Spain,
Benjamin of Tudela, writing more than a century after Basil’s death,
marvelled:
The Greek inhabitants are very rich in gold and precious stones, and
they go clothed in garments of silk with gold embroidery, and they ride
horses, and look like princes. Indeed, the land is very rich in all cloth
stuffs, and in bread, meat, and wine. Wealth like that of Constantinople
is not to be found in the whole world.1
This reputation acted as a magnet to soldiers and traders from far and
wide. The elite Varangian guard, which protected the imperial palace,
recruited Russians, Vikings from as far away as Scandinavia and Iceland,
Normans, and Anglo-Saxons. From Italy, merchants began arriving from
the rival trading centres of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa. Soon, there would be

so many of them that they would be granted their own quarter, where they
could make permanent homes with their families, on the opposite side of
the Golden Horn from the city proper, in the area known as Galata. The
Byzantine capital that Benjamin saw must have been one of the most
cosmopolitan places on earth. The scholar and teacher Ioannes Tzetzes,
writing at about the same time as that visit, boasted of his familiarity with
half a dozen languages that he would hear spoken daily in the streets around
him: Latin, Persian, Georgian, Arabic, Slavonic, Hebrew, as well as his
native Greek. Eustathios of Thessalonica, the city’s bishop and famous for
his commentaries on Homer, was struck by the exotic speech and costumes
of visitors he encountered at the imperial court in the capital. From the
names that Eustathios gives them, we can identify steppe nomads,
Hungarians, Serbs, Turks, Armenians, Indians, sub-Saharan Africans,
northern Europeans, and Italians—while others, he says, were ‘so remote
and outlandish that even their names were unpronounceable’.2

10. The Byzantine Empire in the mid-eleventh century

3307

From the middle of the eleventh century until very nearly the end of the
next, Constantinople was at the centre of a new flourishing of the arts and a
renewed engagement with the intellectual achievements of the ancient
world. The most brilliant all-round man of letters of the age was Michael
Psellos. Born in 1018, Psellos served several emperors in high positions in
the imperial bureaucracy and went on to write a scathing history of the
fourteen reigns he had lived through, from the accession of Basil II in 976
down to the eve of his own death in 1078. The Chronographia, as this
history is called in Greek, is full of psychological insights and the wry
observations of an insider. Deeply versed in ancient Greek philosophy,
Psellos also wrote treatises on many branches of science. More than five
hundred of his elegantly written personal letters have survived. After a gap
of many centuries, Psellos and several of his contemporaries wrote as selfaware individuals, anxious to explore (and indeed to promote) their own
place in the secular world in which they found themselves. Psellos has often
been called a forerunner of modern humanism. The remarkable explosion of
literary creativity in Constantinople that followed during the century after
his death has invited comparison with the better-known achievements of the
Renaissance in the West that would not begin for another two hundred
years.3
Secular genres that had been neglected or forgotten since the days of the
Second Sophistic, under the Roman Empire, suddenly came back into
fashion. Novels (or romances) once again explored the redemptive
possibilities of human love. Satires mocked the pretensions of real
individuals or parodied well-known types from ancient literature. There was
even an attempt at epic poetry based on oral narratives that must have
circulated in the badlands of eastern Anatolia and Mesopotamia during the
centuries of conflict against the Arabs. Freelance writers vied for
commissions from the imperial family or other highly placed officials. To
judge from the sheer volume of their work that has come down to us, there
must have been careers to be made from reciting the praises of living
patrons and the obituaries of their deceased relatives—even if those careers
were also precarious.4
Elegant, erudite, sometimes witty, and on occasion scurrilous, these new
practitioners of the art of rhetoric could turn their hand to any literary style

and write in any type of Greek, from the long-obsolete idiom of the Iliad
and the Odyssey, via the ‘high style’ of classical Athens, to the plainer
manner of everyday bureaucratic exchanges and even, for the first time
since Aristophanes in the fifth century BCE, the language of the
contemporary street. The most prolific poet of the twelfth century,
Theodoros Prodromos, was also the most versatile. It is to Prodromos that
we owe some of the earliest recorded cadences of the Greek language as it
is still spoken today. We hear them in this famous rant, addressed to no less
a person than the emperor himself. The poet’s skills have gone unrewarded
for too long, he complains; now he has had enough:
Letters be damned, dear Christ, and all who’ve any truck with them,
damn the time and damn the day when I was sent to school
to learn my letters—fat chance, that, to earn a living!5
During the same two centuries, the building of new churches and
monasteries went on as never before. By the time that Benjamin of Tudela
visited, there was a church for every day of the year in the capital alone.
The huge monastery of the Pantokrator, overlooking the Golden Horn, was
built in the 1130s to house the tombs of emperors, and it survives today as
the Zeyrek Mosque. Contemporary rulers, who were often the Byzantines’
enemies, competed with one another to emulate the architecture and
decoration of their churches and palaces, possibly also recruiting craftsmen
trained in Constantinople for the purpose. Some of the best-preserved
church interiors in the Byzantine style are to be found in Sicily, at Cefalù
and at Monreale outside Palermo, where the Palazzo dei Normanni is also
the nearest thing to a Byzantine palace that survives anywhere. All of these
were commissioned by the island’s Norman rulers in the twelfth century.
Churches of this period, designed and painted in the Byzantine style, can
also be seen in today’s Ukraine and Russia, in Kiev and Novgorod.6
These achievements are all the more remarkable when set against the
political and military realities of the time. A mere forty years after the death
of Basil II, Byzantium found itself faced with new and aggressive enemies
on all sides during the 1060s: Seljuk Turks in the east, Normans in the west,

and in the north the latest nomadic groups to arrive from the steppes, known
as Pechenegs and Cumans. From this time on, every Byzantine emperor
would be forced back to the policy of defensive imperialism that had been
the hallmark of the first centuries after the Arab conquest: a combination of
limited, defensive wars with proactive diplomacy on several fronts
simultaneously.
After a period of messy court intrigue, described in forensic detail by
Psellos, in 1068 the empire once again had a military man on the throne.
Romanos IV Diogenes set out for eastern Anatolia to take the war to the
Seljuks, who had conquered Baghdad in 1055. At first he seemed to be
having some success. Then, in August 1071, at a place called Manzikert,
close to Lake Van, a disastrous error of tactics led to the emperor being
taken prisoner by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan (‘the Lion’). The emperor
was treated much more generously by his captor than he would be by his
own people after his release. In the early stages of the ensuing civil war,
that would last for almost a decade, Romanos was blinded and despatched
to a monastery, where he died shortly afterwards. There were no rewards for
failure in the Byzantine system.7
The Seljuks pushed westwards to capture Smyrna on the Aegean coast
and Nicaea (today’s Iznik), only ninety kilometres to the southeast of
Constantinople. Anatolia, and not the European provinces, had long since
become the heartland of the Greek-speaking world. Now, between 1071 and
the mid-1090s, the centre of gravity of that world was forcibly shifted back
to where it had started out, in the southern Balkans and the Aegean. On the
Byzantines’ opposite flank, beyond the Adriatic, the Normans had come a
long way from their small kingdom on the north coast of what is now
France to become a powerful new force in the Mediterranean. In the same
year as the battle of Manzikert, 1071, they captured Bari, the last remaining
Byzantine possession in southern Italy. Over the next twenty years, the
Normans went on to complete the conquest of Sicily from the Arabs,
something the Byzantines had never managed to do. Ten years after that, a
Norman expedition crossed the southern Adriatic to land on the west coast
of Epiros. Led by Robert Guiscard, one of the most formidable soldiers of
the age, this was a direct threat to the integrity of the Byzantine state in the

Balkans. Meanwhile, on the northern frontiers, Pecheneg tribesmen were
making repeated raids across the Danube.
In Constantinople, the civil war ended just in time for a robust response to
these emergencies. On 1 April 1081, Alexios Komnenos, an aristocrat from
a military family in Anatolia, seized the throne in a well-organised coup
d’état. For the first time in Byzantine history, this emperor would go on to
establish his own family as a kind of ruling caste, to the point that in time
the family name would come to signify a distinguished rank—much as the
name ‘Caesar’ had once done in ancient Rome. We are exceptionally well
informed about the character and achievements of Alexios thanks to his
daughter Anna, who several decades after his death would become the first
female historian to write in Greek—indeed, quite possibly in any language.
Anna’s account of her father’s reign is written in a revival of the grand style
of Herodotus and Thucydides; as a stylist and historian, she makes a worthy
successor to Psellos. But the title of her work gives due warning of her
purpose: the Alexiad of Anna Komnene, with its overt nod towards Homer’s
Iliad, also foreshadows the modern genre of celebrity biography.8
The new emperor found formidable difficulties in his way. By this time
the theme system that Nikephoros I had devised almost three centuries
before had largely broken down. Local communities no longer contributed
the manpower for their own defence. Instead, the Byzantine state had come
to rely on mercenary soldiers, often recruited, like the Varangians, from
outside its borders. The loyalty of these troops was not always reliable. And
the money had to be found to pay them. Alexios inherited a treasury that
was seriously depleted and a currency that had been repeatedly debased
over the previous decades. Reading Anna’s history, and indeed modern
accounts too, one wonders how so many foreigners could have continued to
believe for so long in the fabulous wealth of Constantinople. Evidently,
these things were relative. But establishing a new stable currency and filling
the imperial coffers were among the first challenges to be faced by Alexios.
By the early 1090s, he had defeated Guiscard and the Normans in
northern Greece and the Pechenegs in Thrace. On the Seljuk front in
Anatolia, it looked for a time as though diplomacy, in the form of lavish
gifts and hospitality, was going to be successful. But by the middle of the
decade, a series of upheavals in the Seljuk sultanate turned all these plans

upside down. The impregnable fortress of Nicaea, on its lake, remained in
the hands of implacable enemies, while others controlled much of the
hinterland of Anatolia. From his base in Smyrna, the emir Çaka, or
Tzachas, was in control of the coast and harried Byzantine shipping in the
Aegean. As one modern account puts it, ‘The situation facing Byzantium in
the mid-1090s was not so much desperate as catastrophic.’9
From those unlikely beginnings arose an event that in its way would leave
almost as great a mark on subsequent world history as the Muslim
conquests of half a millennium before. We know it as the First Crusade,
although the term would not become current until a good deal later. Among
its long-term consequences would be the collapse of the empire that it had
first been conceived to protect. What Alexios needed was manpower. In
particular, given the very specific demands if Nicaea were to be retaken by
force, he needed siege engines. The western kingdoms were ahead in this
kind of military technology at the time. What Alexios seems to have had in
mind was simply another call-up of mercenaries from abroad. But with
money so short, they could be paid in a different currency—not cash but
faith.
Envoys sent by Alexios caught up with Pope Urban II while he was
attending a church council in the northern Italian city of Piacenza in March
1095. In the emperor’s name they begged the pope to raise troops in the
western kingdoms for ‘the defence of this holy church, which had now been
nearly annihilated in that region by the infidels who had conquered as far as
the walls of Constantinople’. The pope was shrewd enough to see the
benefits to his own office from taking up this diplomatic challenge. The
‘holy church’ of which the envoys spoke had been officially split for the
past four decades—ever since the patriarch in Constantinople and the
emissaries of a previous pope had excommunicated each other in 1054.
Though it seems to have created little stir at the time, that event is still
remembered as the ‘Great Schism’ that marked the irrevocable split
between the churches that we now know as Roman Catholic and Eastern
Orthodox.10
Four decades after the schism, the appeal by Alexios opened up the
possibility not only of a reconciliation but also of papal authority being
extended to the eastern church and its clergy. At the same time, a

groundswell of anti-Muslim sentiment in western Europe had been
growing, partly because the coming of the Seljuks had made it much more
difficult for Christian pilgrims to make the journey to the Holy Land. The
time was ripe to declare a holy war. Alexios, for his part, was seeking
reinforcements to protect his empire from invasion by the Muslim Seljuks.
But the clarion call that was heard in the west was the more symbolic one:
to ‘liberate’ Jerusalem and the holy places of Christianity.
After a summer spent sounding out potential leaders, Urban formally
announced what would become the First Crusade in the town of Clermont
Ferrand in central France in November 1095. The response was beyond
anything Alexios or his advisers could possibly have imagined. Noblemen
and knights from all over western Europe rushed to join up. Urban had been
determined to oversee an organised military expedition. And this was what
Alexios was expecting. But once the torch had been lit, there was no way of
controlling the fire. While preparations were still going ahead under
Urban’s careful supervision, a spontaneous movement sprang up in northern
France and parts of Germany. Inspired by a charismatic individual known
as Peter the Hermit, but without any organised leadership, the ‘People’s
Crusade’, as it came to be known, set out through Germany and the Balkans
for Constantinople on their way to Jerusalem. Before they even reached
Byzantine territory, they had begun their holy war by massacring or forcibly
converting the Jewish populations of the German towns they passed
through. Anna Komnene, who was writing with the benefit of half a century
of hindsight, chose to suppress altogether the fact that the father whom she
revered had brought this invasion upon his own head. She describes their
arrival like this:
It was as if he [Peter the Hermit] had inspired every heart with some
divine command. Kelts assembled from all parts, one after another, with
arms and horses and all the other equipment for war. Full of enthusiasm
and ardour they thronged every highway, and with these warriors came a
host of civilians, outnumbering the sand of the seashore or the stars of
heaven, carrying palms and bearing crosses on their shoulders. There
were women and children, too, who had left their own countries. Like
tributaries joining a river from all directions they streamed towards us in
full force.

Adroitly, if cynically in the eyes of some western observers, Alexios had
the whole contingent shipped over the Sea of Marmara to the advance base
he had prepared for the main expedition on the Asian shore. Against his
advice, they then went on to attack the nearby Turks with horrific ferocity,
only to be butchered in their turn. Peter was one of the few to make it back
to Constantinople—saved, according to Anna, by the timely intervention of
her father.11
The arrival of the contingents that made up the main force was managed
rather better. Alexios had laid elaborate plans to keep them supplied with
provisions. He also sent military escorts to stop them plundering the
countryside while they made their way overland to the Bosphorus from
their various landing points on the western coasts of today’s Albania and
Greece. Their numbers must have been far beyond anything that Alexios
could have expected. Modern estimates suggest that as many as eighty
thousand may have taken part in the First Crusade.12 It was never a unified
army, and from the start Alexios was determined to keep it that way. He
ensured that the troops were kept well away from Constantinople. Only
their leaders were allowed inside the city and, so far as possible, he dealt
with each of them separately.
Alexios’s objective was to extract from each an oath of allegiance. All
cities and territories that the crusaders captured on their expedition were to
be handed over to the emperor, as their rightful ruler. Many of the leaders
demurred. The full panoply of Byzantine diplomacy, and the targeted
channelling of ostentatious bribes in gold, had to be deployed. Alexios was
playing for high stakes. But from his point of view, far from being recruited
by the crusaders to serve their cause, he was recruiting them as a ‘Byzantine
imperial army’. Whether they would ever make it as far as Jerusalem was
not his concern: properly handled, these people were to be the means of
restoring Anatolia to ‘Roman’ rule. It must have seemed worth it. And in
any case, now that the crusaders were there, and in such numbers, Alexios
had little choice.13
After several months of haggling in Constantinople, all the leaders agreed.
Even Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard, who had fought against
Byzantium before and would again, found it expedient to comply. By early
summer 1097, all the crusader forces were in place, encamped outside

Nicaea. Alexios himself crossed over the Bosphorus with a force of his own
and two of his most trusted generals and directed operations from not far
away. The ‘impregnable’ fortress fell on 19 June. But the manner of its
taking explains a great deal about the different aims and methods of the
Byzantines and the crusaders.
The westerners brought superior technology. The crossbow doesn’t seem
to have played a role at Nicaea but was still enough of a novelty that the
normally contemptuous Anna felt it necessary, half a century later, to give
her readers an admiring account of how it worked and how deadly it was.
Siege engines were built by both Byzantines and crusaders, and there seems
to have been some disagreement about whose were the more effective. If
the western advantage in this field had been Alexios’s first motivation in
drawing them in, it was not directly decisive in the outcome.14 Nicaea was
not taken by storm. It says something for the way sieges were conducted in
this part of the world at the time that Alexios’s trusted aide and general,
Manuel Boutoumites, was able to enter the city and negotiate with the
defenders, not once but twice. On the second occasion, a relieving army
sent by the sultan had just been wiped out by the crusaders; Alexios had
arranged for a fleet of boats to be carried overland from the Sea of Marmara
and launched on the lake in front of the fortress. The defenders could no
longer be supplied by that route. Without these military pressures, no
diplomacy could have been effective. But with them, in classic Byzantine
manner, Alexios was spared the effort and expense of a debilitating siege.
The Turkish commanders agreed to surrender in return for a guarantee of
safety, signed by Alexios himself, and the promise of money and honours if
they would serve him in future. (Characteristically, Anna, who evidently
relishes the story, tells us nothing about what was to happen to the rank and
file.) But first, the crusaders had to be duped into thinking that the city had
been won by force and that the decisive breakthrough had been made by the
Byzantine army. So the defenders allowed an advance guard from a
Byzantine siege tower to climb over the walls. Victory was proclaimed, and
the Turks surrendered to Boutoumites. Only once the whole city was secure
were any crusaders allowed inside—and then only in groups of ten, a
precaution, according to Anna, against their overwhelming numbers and
‘their fickle nature and passionate, impulsive whims’.15

After that, the crusaders were to proceed to Antioch. The emperor would
join them there, having in the meantime subdued the western parts of
Anatolia—as his forces were now able to do, thanks to the terror instilled in
the Seljuk defenders by the presence of the crusaders farther east. It was
during the siege of Antioch, which was finally taken a year after Nicaea,
that the alliance between the crusaders and the Byzantines began to fall
apart when Bohemond seized the city for himself. In the meantime,
Alexios’s generals campaigned successfully against the Seljuks in western
Anatolia, but he himself remained in Constantinople. There could be no
prospect of a reunion in Antioch now that Bohemond had gone back on his
oath.16
From Antioch, the crusaders went on their way to Jerusalem to seize the
city and massacre everyone in it on 15 July 1099. Against enormous odds,
and at terrible cost in human life, they had won their ‘holy war’. Most of
them, by that time, had become convinced that Alexios and the ‘Greeks’
were not to be trusted. These Greeks did deals with infidels. They failed to
keep their promises—though this was a complaint heard only after large
amounts of Byzantine gold had already changed hands.
The truth must be that both parties had quite distinct agendas in the first
place. No Byzantine emperor, for hundreds of years, had ever seriously
thought of trying to recapture Jerusalem. A crusade, from the Byzantine
point of view, would make no strategic sense. The very idea of holy war,
that had begun with Heraclius, had long ago become outdated in
Byzantium. Alexios had been prepared, no doubt with great misgivings, to
ride the tiger of crusader religious passions for pragmatic reasons. But he
also recognised the danger he had unleashed. Before he died in 1118, he
would exhort his son and chosen heir, John II, to
ponder and keep in mind the recent commotion from the West, lest there
arise a time of need which will chasten and humble the lofty dignity of
New Rome and the majesty of its throne.17
Alexios’s deathbed warning was to prove prophetic—but not for some time
yet, thanks to the capable stewardship of his son and his grandson, whose
reigns, together with his own, would add up to a full century.

In the event, John II would be spared another such ‘commotion’ during his
reign. Instead, he had to find a way to deal with a proliferation of new
Christian states in the Levant, that had been created in the wake of the First
Crusade. Their rulers were Catholic princes who, like Bohemond before
them, still refused to recognise the ‘emperor of the Greeks’ as their
overlord. By 1143, John II had made up his mind to take control of the
crusader states by force. But as his army was passing through southern
Anatolia, the emperor was killed in an accident while hunting. Suspicions
about the nature of this ‘accident’ have surfaced from time to time, not least
because the campaign had to be immediately aborted. The new emperor,
Manuel I, needed to have his army near the capital to secure his own
position.18
If the crusader states in the east had been spared attack from Byzantium,
they were now coming under a sustained onslaught from the Seljuks. The
County of Edessa, which included a sizeable part of today’s Syria, fell in
1144. Three years later, a new crusade set out from western Europe to try to
win it back. This time the expedition was led not by mere noblemen and
minor royalty but by two of the crowned heads of western Europe: Louis
VII of France and the German emperor, Conrad III. They passed by
Constantinople in 1147 on their way east, and again the next year on their
return, having failed to regain Edessa. The arrival of huge foreign armies,
uninvited this time, outside Constantinople once again raised the same
jitters as before. But Manuel dealt with the crusaders as his grandfather had
done. He kept the rank and file of the soldiery well away from the capital,
and his coffers were full enough that he could afford to lavish generous
hospitality on the expedition’s leaders.
Both royal guests, as a result, spent several months in the vicinity of
Constantinople. Although we know tantalisingly little about how they spent
their time, their courtiers must have had plenty of opportunity to exchange
ideas with their Byzantine counterparts. By the time they left again, without
serious incident, it seems that mutual animosity between the western
knights and the Byzantine elite was much less than it had been during the
First Crusade, or would be again. It may even be that the literary genre we
know as the ‘medieval romance’, that first began to flourish in French
during the following decades, owed something to these encounters with the

Byzantine court during the passage of the Second Crusade. In the early
1170s, in northern France, it was possible for Chrétien de Troyes to devise a
historical fiction in which a prince of Constantinople travels to Britain and
saves the kingdom for King Arthur, while in the next generation, King
Arthur himself prepares an expedition to defend the legitimate heir to the
throne of ‘Greece’ in Constantinople.19
On the Byzantine side, too, attitudes were changing, at least at the very
top. Manuel, throughout his long reign, was known to be pro-western. Both
his first and his second wife came from western royal families and had been
brought up in the Catholic branch of the Christian faith. Famously, Manuel
imported from the west the sport of jousting—to the bemusement of
conservative-minded Byzantine spectators.20 This was a far cry from the icy
contempt of Anna Komnene, whenever she wrote about ‘Franks’, ‘Latins’,
or ‘Kelts’, the names by which western Europeans were commonly known
in Greek at this time. Whatever the rank and file of his subjects thought,
here was an emperor who was prepared to take these ‘barbarians’ seriously.
It was Manuel’s diplomacy, not force, that eventually brought the rulers of
the crusader states in the east to accept Byzantine supremacy in the 1060s,
even if it was only nominal. This was how long it had taken to fulfil the
terms that Alexios had tried and failed to impose more than half a century
before. Manuel worked hard, too, to advance the cause of union between
the eastern and western churches—a prospect that once had been held out
by Alexios but had stalled after the First Crusade.
By the 1170s, all this was beginning to provoke a backlash at home. Then
in 1176, the Byzantine army suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of
the Seljuks, at the battle of Myriokephalon in west-central Anatolia.
Manuel’s prestige at home and abroad never recovered. He died on 24
September 1180, at the age of sixty-one. And from that moment, everything
that had been achieved during the Komnenian century began to unravel. In
the space of a little over two decades after Manuel’s death, the Byzantine
Empire collapsed from within.
Historians ever since have struggled to explain what happened and why,
and exactly what was its impact on the course of later history. But Niketas
Choniates, who lived through these events and rose through the ranks to

become head of the Byzantine civil service during the crisis years at the
beginning of the thirteenth century, was merciless in his diagnosis of the
symptoms of what today we can call ‘systems collapse’. Choniates is
regarded as one of the most accomplished of all Byzantine historians. His
position as an insider ensures that what he tells us is most likely to reflect
the opinions of the Constantinopolitan elite at the time. His specific
diagnoses sometimes reveal the prejudices of the man himself or his class.
Choniates’s contempt for the ‘mob’, for instance, is as visceral as his dislike
of Franks or Latins. And we must allow for the possibility that he and those
who thought like him may at times have been part of the problem. But the
facts speak for themselves.21
Once again, in 1180, a widowed empress was left as regent for an
underage heir. But this time, infighting within the ruling Komnenos family,
and between the Komnenoi and powerful aristocratic rivals, led to a power
vacuum that would last for more than twenty years. Reigning emperors
were deposed, and in most cases blinded, or murdered, or both, in 1182,
1185, 1195, and no fewer than four times in a little over a year, between
1203 and 1204. On each of these occasions, the populace of Constantinople
played a noisy, and often violent, part. Indeed, it is worth wondering
whether something rather like today’s populism was beginning to run out of
control at the heart of the Byzantine body politic.22
In the course of the upheaval of 1182, seemingly spontaneous hatred of
Latins spilled over into the streets. The communities of merchants from
Italy—particularly, at that time, from Pisa and Genoa—living on the
opposite side of the Golden Horn from Constantinople, were targeted, and
hundreds were massacred. The killing was on nothing like the scale of the
massacre of Roman settlers in Anatolia that had been organised by
Mithridates more than a thousand years before. But the spectre of what a
future age would term ‘ethnic cleansing’ was once again raising its head in
the Greek-speaking world. Three years later, and partly in reprisal, the
Normans of Sicily invaded the northern Greek mainland yet again. This
time they succeeded in sacking Thessalonica before they were turned back.
In 1189, a third crusade reached Constantinople in a doomed attempt to win
back Jerusalem after the city had fallen to the Kurdish leader Saladin. The
emperor Isaac II Angelos proved to be no match for the crusade’s leaders,

in a battle of wits with the German emperor Frederick Barbarossa, King
Richard (‘the Lionheart’) of England, and Philip II of France. There even
came a moment when they threatened to turn on Constantinople itself.
Similar things had happened often enough before, and the empire had
recovered. But now they all came on top of one another. And a new trend
was gathering momentum in the closing years of the twelfth century. In the
past, whenever a rebellion had broken out in the provinces, its leader would
either end up being swept to power in Constantinople or his movement
would be crushed. It had been all or nothing. But no longer. By 1200, local
members of aristocratic families, including the Komnenoi, had set up
separate fiefdoms in places as far apart as Cyprus, Trebizond, the city of
Philadelphia in western Anatolia, and the Peloponnese. At the same time,
the Slavs of the Balkans broke away to create the separate kingdoms of
Serbia and Bulgaria, at a stroke undoing the conquests of Basil the Bulgar
Slayer. The authority of the capital over the provinces had collapsed, just as
imperial authority was collapsing in the city itself.23
At the same time, in the west, momentum was gathering for a new attempt
to regain Jerusalem. Inspired by Pope Innocent III, who came to the papal
throne in 1198, this would become known as the Fourth Crusade. Unlike
previous expeditions, this one was to be undertaken by sea. Ships provided
by the maritime republic of Venice would convey the knights to Egypt. The
final assault on the Holy Land would be launched from there. The
pragmatic Venetians were more interested in trading than crusading. The
doge of Venice, the ninety-five-year-old Enrico Dandolo, agreed to the
crusaders’ terms, on condition that they paid for the services of his fleet.
Led by the doge himself and Boniface of Montferrat, a relative of the
French king, the expedition set out from Venice in October 1202. But
almost from the first, it became evident that the crusaders had not enough
money to pay the Venetians what they owed. A providential solution came
in the form of a young Byzantine prince called Alexios. This was the son of
Isaac II Angelos, who had been deposed back in 1195 when the throne had
been usurped by his uncle, Alexios III. If only the crusaders would divert
their expedition to Constantinople and restore him to his rightful position as
emperor, the younger Alexios promised to repay them out of the imperial
treasury with all that they needed.

Despite allegations that would first be made soon after the event and that
have resurfaced frequently ever since, neither Pope Innocent nor the leaders
of the crusade had any deep-laid plan to conquer Constantinople. Indeed, it
seems to have been only at a late stage that it even occurred to them that
they could. From accounts written by crusaders afterwards, it is evident that
they looked with awe on the city, its defences, and the military might that
the emperor could command.24 Along with those, of course, went the lure
of its fabulous wealth, which nobody doubted would be enough to repay
their debt to the Venetians and cover the costs of the crusade many times
over. It was the Byzantines themselves who played into the crusaders’
hands, as the deepening power vacuum at the city’s heart inexorably drew
them towards it.
The expedition arrived with the Venetian fleet in the Bosphorus in June
1203 and set up camp on the Asian shore. The pretender Alexios proved
much less welcome among his own people than he had led the crusaders to
expect. In a bid to enforce his claim, Venetian ships fought their way into
the narrow waterway that gave access to the heart of the city, the Golden
Horn. Once inside, they overwhelmed a much-reduced Byzantine navy and
took control of the shoreline below the walls. In the face of this pressure,
the desired regime change took place: the crusaders’ young protégé was
crowned in Hagia Sophia as Alexios IV Angelos. In the meantime, the
Venetian ships stayed inside the Golden Horn. Others ferried the crusaders
across the strait, from their camp on the Asian shore. The expedition was
now ensconced right under the walls of Constantinople. In every previous
emergency, the Byzantine fleet had kept control of the waterways that
surrounded the city on three sides. Now, with their ships beached or
captured, there was no chance of launching the deadly ‘Greek fire’ that had
ensured Byzantine supremacy at sea for centuries.25
All that was needed, at this point, was for the imperial treasury to pay up,
as the new emperor had promised, and the crusaders would be gone. But
even at this moment, when the danger should have been obvious, the
prevailing opinion within the city seems to have reverted to the traditional
one, that went back to the time of Alexios I: these ‘Franks’ were barbarians.
Their brute strength existed to be exploited to serve Byzantine ends; savage
and unpredictable as they were, they could always be managed through the

age-old diplomatic techniques of bribery and division. The more nuanced
approach of Manuel I seemed to have been forgotten. Under the influence
of this way of thinking, Alexios dragged his feet. Attitudes inside the city
were hardening too—perhaps a further sign of the growing influence of
populism on decision-making.26
By the start of the new year, 1204, the patience of the crusaders was
wearing thin. But so was the anger on the streets of Constantinople. Alexios
was overthrown on 25 January and murdered shortly afterwards. The new
emperor was Alexios V Doukas, known by the nickname Mourtzouphlos
(‘Bushy’, apparently because his eyebrows were joined in the middle).
There was still time to buy off the crusaders. It was what any competent
ruler in the centuries-old Byzantine tradition would have done. And
apparently Mourtzouphlos did have the means to pay. It is not clear to what
extent the emperor was a free agent; most likely, his hands were tied by
powerful advisers or by the ever-growing power of the mob. Instead of
paying, Mourtzouphlos haughtily handed down an ultimatum to the
crusaders: he gave them just a week to sail away.27
The decision to take Constantinople by force seems not to have been
reached until February. During March, plans were drawn up by Dandolo,
Boniface, and the other leaders of the crusade for a division of the spoils.
Then on the morning of Monday, 12 April 1204, the Venetian galleys inside
the Golden Horn carried siege engines mounted precariously on their decks
and brought them right up against the walls at their weakest point. The first
groups of crusaders leapt onto the ramparts in this way. Others, under cover
of the siege engines, broke through a bricked-up postern gate. Fighting
continued in the streets for the rest of the day. Mourtzouphlos fled that
night. Yet another emperor was chosen, but by the next morning no one was
willing to fight on, and he too abandoned the city. Within twenty-four
hours, Constantinople had been overrun. On 13 April, the never-silenced
mob was back on the streets, this time chanting the name of Boniface as
their basileus. But nothing, now, could stop the pent-up rage of the
crusaders. As Choniates, who had experienced it, wrote shortly afterwards:
Thus it fell out that the fair city of Constantine, the shared delight of all
peoples and famed by all, was blackened by fire and obliterated,

conquered and emptied of all its riches, whether public, private or
dedicated to God, by the scattered tribes of the west, a feeble rabble for
the most part and without a name.28
What we now call the ‘Byzantine Empire’ would limp on for another two
and a half centuries after this. But it would never again be a significant
political force. And from that April day in 1204, the overwhelming majority
of Greek speakers would have to get used to living under rulers who shared
neither their language nor their religion, a state of affairs that would last
until 1923.

HOPEFUL MONSTERS
1204–1453

T

he destruction of the greatest Christian city in the world by Christian

crusaders was not universally welcomed even in western Europe. Pope
Innocent III, who had called for the crusade to set out in the first place,
denounced the soldiers of Christ for betraying their vows to liberate the
Holy Land. The savagery of their behaviour in the conquered city would
only make them hated by their Orthodox co-religionists, he complained.1
Byzantines belonging to the educated elite, such as Niketas Choniates, or
Anna Komnene before him, had been convinced from the start that the
ultimate goal of the crusading movement had been not the Holy Land but
the far richer pickings of their own. The events of the Fourth Crusade
seemed to prove them right. And for many in the Greek-speaking world,
thereafter, this view would become deeply ingrained.
In reality, the crusaders and the Venetians had probably surprised
themselves as much as anyone else by what they had done. Afterwards, the
victors found themselves in a weaker position than they might have
expected. The plans drawn up by the leaders in March 1204 had been for a
division of the spoils, not a takeover of a functioning empire. Even
Constantinople had to be divided—with Hagia Sophia and the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction that went with it going to the Venetians, while a new ‘Latin’
emperor, the former Count Baldwin of Flanders, ruled from the Blacherna
palace at the other end of the Golden Horn. Boniface of Montferrat, who
had been the nominal leader of the crusade but missed out on the imperial
title, became king of Thessalonica instead.

Within the next few years, the Venetians went on to secure their hold on
islands and coastlines that would become the basis for a commercial,
maritime ‘empire’ in the eastern Mediterranean. Other islands, and parts of
Constantinople itself, would fall to Genoa, Venice’s bitter trading rival. On
the Greek mainland, former imperial provinces were parcelled out among
leading crusaders, who then ended up fighting to claim them from the local
inhabitants, or sometimes from each other. Wherever they succeeded, the
new rulers went on to organise their territories according to the western,
feudal system. In theory, this meant that each of them owed allegiance to
their overlord in Constantinople. But in reality, the ‘Latin Empire’, as it
came to be known, ended up as no more than a city-state consisting of the
capital, its immediate hinterland in Thrace, and a small wedge of territory
on the Asian side of the Bosphorus between the Black Sea and the Sea of
Marmara. Its supposedly feudal vassals went their own way.
The effect of all this was to shatter the highly organised, centralised
Byzantine state into a kaleidoscope of petty fiefdoms, principalities, and
kingdoms. Some of these would change hands, swap allegiances, and shift
their boundaries many times, as the kaleidoscope continued to turn. During
the next three centuries, Greek speakers living on the European side of the
Aegean and on the islands, from the Ionian Sea to Cyprus, would find
themselves under the sway of a bewildering variety of rulers at different
times and in different places: French, Venetians, Genoese, Florentines,
Catalans, Aragonese, Navarrese, and (recruited from all over western
Europe) the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John.
Athens, for instance, would be ruled throughout the thirteenth century by
a French baronial family from Burgundy, then for much of the fourteenth by
the descendants of Catalan mercenaries who had briefly run amok through
the Greek mainland before settling there, and finally in the fifteenth by
Italian dukes from Florence. At some point during this time, the Parthenon
was converted from an Orthodox church to a Catholic cathedral; the
massive entrance gateway to the Acropolis, the Propylaea, into a ducal
palace. A hundred-foot tower was built to guard it, in the style of the towers
that still define the skyline in Italian cities and towns such as Bologna and
San Gimignano. The ‘Frankish tower’, as it became known, would remain
the tallest building in Athens until it was demolished in the 1870s. This was
the Athens that would find its way into the pages of the Decameron by

Boccaccio (written in the 1350s), The Knight’s Tale by Chaucer, and
Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream.2
The duchy of Athens was just one among many such states left behind in
the eastern Mediterranean as the tide of the crusades ebbed. Modern
historians often see these states as the precursors of western European
colonial ventures around the world in later centuries.3 From the perspective
of colonial history this makes good sense—there are many continuities in
the behaviours of the rulers. But, with the exception of the Venetians, the
new masters were not acting in the name and interests of a colonial power.
Rather, they were high-ranking adventurers setting up on their own account.
Perhaps a better way to understand what was happening in much of the
Greek-speaking world at this time is to compare it to developments in the
home countries of the ‘colonists’, back in western Europe. There, during the
same centuries, the foundations were being laid for what would later
become national identities, as allegiances, identities, and political loyalties
began to coalesce into the patterns familiar today.4 In the Greek-speaking
east, while the remnants of the old Byzantine Empire broke apart, we can
see comparable signs of new political and cultural identities being formed
and tried out.
In evolutionary biology, mutations that never made it to become
successful species are known as ‘hopeful monsters’. The eastern
Mediterranean had its share of those during the centuries after 1204—and
not only among the supposedly colonial western possessions. Even in those
places where Greek speakers were still (or were once again) in charge, a
very similar process seems to have been at work.
At the eastern end of what had once been the Byzantine state, facing the
southeastern corner of the Black Sea, the port city of Trebizond and its
hinterland had increasingly become cut off from the rest of the empire, both
by geography and by political choice. Descendants of the Komnenoi had
asserted their independence from Constantinople even before 1204. The
mini ‘Empire of Trebizond’ had now become the endpoint of the silk roads
that led overland all the way to China. By making their own arrangements
with the Turkish Muslims to their south, and with the Venetian and Genoese
merchants whose galleys connected Trebizond with the Mediterranean and

western Europe, the canny Byzantines of this region would keep their state
going until 1461.5
At the other end of the geographical spectrum lay Epiros, in the
mountainous west of the Greek peninsula, beyond the formidable barrier of
the Pindos mountains. Here, the grandiosely named Michael Doukas
Komnenos Angelos made the most of his (illegitimate) descent from no
fewer than three formerly imperial families to set up another mini empire,
this time with its capital at Arta. In due course this was to become the
‘Despotate of Epiros’. The rulers of Epiros soon had some success against
the Latins in the north of today’s Greece and in 1224 captured Thessalonica,
bringing them within striking distance of Constantinople.6
Midway between these geographical extremes lay the largest swathe of
their former territory that still remained to the Byzantines. Beginning a few
kilometres east of the Bosphorus and some way south of the Sea of
Marmara, this included much of the Aegean coastline of Anatolia, with its
hinterland. Within this territory, a new provisional capital was established
not far from Constantinople at Nicaea. Ironically, this was the impregnable
fortress-city on its lake that Alexios I had retaken from the Seljuks, thanks
to help from the First Crusade. It was there, in 1208, that a relative of the
Angelos dynasty, Theodore Laskaris, was crowned emperor. From that time
on, the newly reconstituted imperial court at Nicaea would be singleminded in its aim: to recapture the capital city and reestablish the authority
of the emperor as it had been before.7
But in the fragmented Greek world of the thirteenth century, there could
be no question of the three Byzantine successor states making common
cause to achieve this. It is entirely characteristic that the decisive battle,
whose outcome would determine the course of the empire’s final centuries,
was fought not between Byzantines and Latins but between the rival Greek
‘emperors’ of Nicaea and Epiros over which of them was to repossess the
imperial capital. The battle of Pelagonia was fought in July 1259 near the
modern town of Bitola, in North Macedonia, between proxies for Michael II
Doukas, based in Arta, and a new usurper who had been crowned in Nicaea,
Michael VIII Palaiologos. The Nicaean side won. And so the way was open
for the last great dynasty of Byzantine emperors, the Palaiologoi, to rule
from Constantinople.8

By this time, it was evident that the capital was ripe for the taking. A
Latin emperor, Baldwin II, still ruled at the Blacherna palace. But deprived
of the revenues of its hinterland, cut off from all its previous sources of
food and wealth, and without material support from western Europe,
Constantinople was quite literally falling into ruin under its Latin rulers.
The Greek-speaking Orthodox population had melted away. In the capital,
streets and houses were deserted. The city authorities had been reduced to
stripping timber and lead from the roofs of churches to raise cash. Baldwin
II even had to sell off some of the most priceless assets of all in that
intensely religious age: those relics of the saints that had not already been
looted in the sack of 1204.9
The reconquest, when it came, was an anticlimax. A small expeditionary
force sent out from Nicaea to keep watch on the city walls from the
European side of the Bosphorus received a tip-off. The Venetian fleet and
most of the defending Latin troops had gone on a raiding expedition into the
Black Sea. The city was practically undefended. With the aid of some local
people, the Nicaean contingent was soon inside. Michael VIII Palaiologos
was able to enter his capital city for the first time, in triumph, on the day of
the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, 15 August 1261.10
For the next twenty years, it must have looked to many observers as
though the old times were back. Everything could go on as it had before.
Evidently, Michael Palaiologos thought so. And he had the personality and
the ruthless determination to make it come true if anybody could. Michael
did all the same things as the Komnenian emperors had done before him.
The geopolitical situation he inherited, once the capital had been restored,
though grave, was after all familiar. The Byzantine state was surrounded by
actual or potential enemies: it had been ever thus, since the beginning. So
Michael rebuilt the war fleet whose last remnants had been destroyed by the
Venetians inside the Golden Horn in the summer of 1203. Taking to the seas
once again, Byzantines began to regain control of the Aegean. Michael
recruited mercenary soldiers and sailors from the ranks of rival powers—
still a risky policy, as it had proved for Alexios I and his successors, but
with the empire’s territory so diminished there was no alternative source of
manpower or (in the case of the navy) expertise. He negotiated trade deals

with the rising city-states of Italy, mainly Venice and Genoa, and exploited
the bitter rivalry between them. This was an even riskier policy, as the
sequel would prove; but it had worked in the past, and if the Byzantines
were to keep the upper hand, it might work again.
Michael exercised the art of diplomacy as skilfully as any Byzantine
emperor, before or after—indeed, so skilfully that no one has ever been able
to determine how much of a hand his agents had in organising the massacre
of French forces that had gathered at Palermo, in Sicily, for the purpose of
destroying his empire in 1282. This was the episode known to history as the
‘Sicilian Vespers’. Like most of his predecessors, ever since the formal
schism between the eastern and western churches, Michael VIII made
overtures to successive popes. If the Orthodox Church were to accept the
jurisdiction of the papacy, rival powers in the west would no longer have
the excuse that the Byzantines were ‘heretical’ and therefore fair game. And
once again it might be possible to recruit armies of western Christians to
prop up the front against the Muslim Turks in the east. In this direction
Michael went further than any of his predecessors. In the French city of
Lyon, a Byzantine embassy signed an act of union with the western church
at a council held in 1274.11
But the world had changed. Not one of these initiatives, that had worked
so well in the twelfth century, proved sustainable in the new world of the
thirteenth. It had taken nothing less than a ‘reign of terror’, waged against
Orthodox churchmen at all levels of the Byzantine hierarchy, to force
through the union between the churches. One of the first acts of Michael’s
son and successor, Andronikos II, after his father died at the end of 1282,
was to bow to near-universal pressure at home and repudiate it.12 The battle
between supporters and opponents of church union would continue for as
long as the Byzantine state lasted. And it would be fought with all the
passions that had once fuelled the ‘battle over images’, iconoclasm. This
time the issue was insoluble. On the one hand, the secular state depended
for its survival on good relations with the rising powers of the west; on the
other, to submit to the alien authority of the pope in Rome, even if only in
matters of the spirit, was seen by most Orthodox, Greek-speaking ‘Romans’
as a betrayal of their very identity.13

In the meantime, more and more ground was being lost to the Turks in
Anatolia. There should have been a golden opportunity for the Byzantines
when the Seljuk sultanate collapsed during the second half of the thirteenth
century under pressure from the Mongols in the east. But neither Michael
VIII nor Andronikos II managed to capitalise on the chaos that ensued.
Instead, a patchwork of new and unstable states emerged under rival
Turkish emirs, who from this time began to encroach ever farther into
former Byzantine territory. In its traditional heartland of Anatolia, there
seems to have been little nostalgia for the Byzantine Empire among the
Greek-speaking Christian population. Of those who found themselves
newly subject to Muslim Turks, large numbers converted to Islam rather
than resist, and they appear to have been willingly absorbed into these
emerging Muslim societies. Why this should have happened, when
elsewhere resistance to western Catholicism was so visceral and strong,
remains to be explained. In these regions, too, hopeful monsters were
emerging out of the mixing of Greek speakers and incomers. But since the
converts would usually lose their language within a generation or two, they
disappear from the historical record as Greeks.14
Then there was finance. The kind of diplomacy that Michael had deployed
so effectively had always been expensive. So, too, was the work of
restoring and rebuilding the capital, after the depredations and neglect of
the crusaders. Revenues were drying up. Disastrously, Andronikos
disbanded the Byzantine navy to save money. This not only left
Constantinople undefended by sea; taken together with the concessions
already made to Venetian and Genoese traders, it placed all maritime trade
and the revenues that came with it in the hands of Italian entrepreneurs and
bankers. By the time Andronikos died in 1328, the shrunken Byzantine state
had once more plunged into a civil war that lasted on and off for seven
years and weakened it still further.
The one sphere in which the Palaiologan restoration looked at all
convincing was in the arts. The historians George Akropolites, George
Pachymeres, and Nikephoros Gregoras followed one another in bearing
eloquent and unflinching testimony to their times. The first of these, a
confidant of Michael VIII Palaiologos who had led the Byzantine
delegation at the Council of Lyon in 1274, also played a leading role in

restoring the system of formal education in the capital. Highly educated
theologians, called ‘philosophers’, continued to probe the boundaries
between the interpretation of Christian doctrine and the ancient
philosophical tradition. Beginning with the scholar and monk Maximos
Planoudes during the second half of the thirteenth century, scholars in
Constantinople, for the first time in seven centuries, learned to read what
the greatest minds of western Christendom had been writing in Latin, from
Saint Augustine in the fifth century down to Saint Thomas Aquinas in their
own time.15
The art of mosaic church decoration made a spectacular comeback when
the church known in Greek as the Chora (today the Kariye Camii) was
redecorated at the personal expense of the polymath, author, and senior civil
servant Theodoros Metochites, between 1315 and 1321. The cycle of
images depicting the life of the Virgin Mary has been much admired since
the mosaics were rediscovered in the twentieth century. But some art
historians have detected the rigidity and artificiality of an overly selfconscious revival. The same can certainly be said of the education
curriculum restored under the direction of Akropolites. Essentially, this was
still the system that went back to the time of the Second Sophistic, more
than a thousand years before. Elite Byzantine writers cultivated an
unchanging form of Greek that was more remote than ever from everyday
speech, since the spoken language had moved on during the intervening
centuries.16
The artistic and intellectual quality of the ‘Palaiologan Renaissance’, as it
is sometimes called, is all the more astonishing when set against the
terminal impoverishment of the state that produced it. But its very qualities
perhaps reveal a reluctance or inability to adapt to a changing world. A
detail in the Chora mosaics gives a hint of this. In one panel, the donor,
Metochites, is depicted on his knees, offering a miniature replica of the
church as a gift to Christ, who is seated on a throne. The concept and the
composition are entirely traditional. What is not is the donor’s hat, which
has the appearance of a turban. The exotic piece of headwear is several
times the size of the wearer’s head and slightly larger than the model church
he holds in his hands. Court fashions evidently were changing, and it
mattered enough to this highly placed official to have the dignity of his

office recorded in its full glory by the anonymous artist. Among the
splendours of a revived artform, that all round the walls of the church seems
to look backwards, the hat is a rare breath of fresh air.
The greatest of all the failures of the restored empire was its inability to
halt the breakup of the Greek-speaking world that had been the root cause
of the disaster of 1204. Even after the restoration, it seems that wherever
Greeks still ruled outside the capital, they no longer wanted to buy into the
empire that their ancestors had helped to build. And where Latins ruled,
despite intensely felt differences between their respective churches, some,
at least, among their Greek subjects now looked to new beginnings rather
than hanker after a lost past.
The Peloponnese, at this time better known by its colloquial Greek name,
‘the Morea’, had been awarded jointly to two French knights from
Champagne in northern France: Geoffrey of Villehardouin and William of
Champlitte. The story of how they conquered the territory and how
Geoffrey ousted his partner to found a dynasty of Villehardouin princes was
told a century later in a remarkable narrative called the Chronicle of the
Morea. The tale would be retold and updated in several different languages
over the next two centuries. But in its oldest version in Greek, the Chronicle
breaks new ground. Unlike all previous histories, this one is written not in
the ‘high style’ favoured in Constantinople but in a language much closer to
the spoken Greek of today. To some extent this must reflect the way that
people actually spoke in the Peloponnese at the time. And it is written in
verse, in a style which may reflect a local tradition of oral storytelling.17
Running to almost ten thousand lines in its longest version, the Chronicle
brings to life a world in which French-speaking ‘Franks’, adherents of the
Latin, western church, make common cause with a portion, at least, of their
Greek-speaking, Orthodox subjects. Near the beginning, the anonymous
author seems to mimic an oral performer, who explicitly addresses both
groups together:
Hearken all, both Franks and Romans [i.e., Greeks]
all ye who trust in Christ and bear the mark of baptism
gather round and hearken to a great matter.18

The Chronicle promotes a strong sense of a shared, regional identity. The
two peoples and the two unreconciled branches of the Christian faith are
brought together under the label ‘Moreots’—the people of the Morea. A
key passage is the imagined speech of Prince William of Villehardouin to
his knights on the eve of the battle of Pelagonia in 1259. They are about to
fight alongside the Greeks of Epiros and against the Greeks of Nicaea (led
by Michael VIII, who would soon restore Byzantine rule to
Constantinople). The Morea, their homeland is far away, William tells
them. But they must fight to retain their good name in the world. Entirely
skipping over the awkward fact (for the many Greeks among them) that the
forces ranged against them are those of the legitimate Byzantine emperor,
William stresses instead that the Byzantine army is made up of mercenaries
who speak a ragbag of different languages. A few lines later, he makes the
contrast:
For even if we are few against them,
we all share a bond as men of one substance,
and so like brothers you all must love one another.19
The odd term that intrudes here, ‘substance’, seems to be borrowed from
the language of theology, as indeed is the echo of the commandment in
Saint John’s Gospel, to ‘love one another’. There is something almost
sacred about the bond that unites these troops, loyal to their Peloponnesian
homeland and its ruler, and that trumps any residual loyalty that some may
have felt towards the resurgent Greek-speaking state of Byzantium.
It is hard to tell how accurate a picture the Chronicle gives of conditions
in the thirteenth-century Peloponnese. Its author celebrates the great
aristocratic families (both French and Greek), who lived in the castles that
still dominate the landscape in many parts of the region today. But the local
peasants and craftsmen whose labour must have built these castles are
passed over in silence. So, as a rule, are the townspeople, foot soldiers,
farmers, and herders on whom the whole system must have depended.
Compared to the civic institutions of the Byzantine Empire, the world of the
Frankish-ruled Morea, as portrayed by its anonymous chronicler, sounds
more primitive, heroic, one might almost say Homeric.20

Indeed, the leading actors in that world seem positively to have relished
their links to the legends of a long-distant age. Soon after the conquest, the
first Villehardouin ruler adopted the title ‘Prince of Achaea’, resurrecting a
name that went back to the Roman Empire, and before that to the
‘Achaeans’ of Trojan War fame. Stories woven around that legendary
ancient conflict once again began to circulate in the Morea—and like the
Chronicle, these, too, were written both in French and in the spoken Greek
of the time. New tastes were being cultivated. Rulers and ruled alike, it
seems, could find role models for themselves among the Greek and Trojan
warriors of legend. In the Morea, until it all began to go into reverse in the
second half of the fourteenth century, a distinct, hybrid Moreot culture and
identity were emerging.21
At the eastern end of the Mediterranean, back in the 1180s, Cyprus had
been one of the first Greek-speaking regions to break away from Byzantine
control; in 1192 the island ended up under the rule of French crusaders even
before the Fourth Crusade. By the time the Kingdom of Cyprus and
Jerusalem, to give it its full title, came into existence, Jerusalem had already
been lost to the crusaders for good. For just short of three hundred years
after that, until 1489, Cyprus would be ruled by the French aristocratic
family of Lusignan, which had previously ruled in Jerusalem. There, the
Greek-speaking, Orthodox majority was more obviously treated as secondclass citizens than in the Morea. But they were not persecuted; attempts to
convert them forcibly to the Latin church were few, and successfully
resisted.
During the centuries of Lusignan rule, Cyprus enjoyed a stable political
system. New institutions emerged and new loyalties formed. Once again,
local people must have been conscripted in huge numbers to build the
Gothic cathedral of Nicosia, the abbey of Bellapais in the hills above
Kyrenia, the towering castles of Saint Hilarion and Buffavento nearby, or
‘Othello’s tower’ in Famagusta, that would later be imagined as the setting
for Shakespeare’s play. The great churches of late medieval Cyprus were all
built and consecrated by the rulers for the western, Catholic faith; the native
population had to make do with the humbler buildings whose exquisitely

decorated interiors can still be admired in villages tucked into folds of the
Troodos mountains in the island’s south.
Even in these less than favourable circumstances, Greek speakers had a
role to play in Lusignan Cyprus at most levels below the very highest. By
the time they found a voice that we can still hear, in the 1430s, the
fragmentation of the Greek world had extended even to the language. For
the first time since the post-Mycenaean dark age, Greek had once again
split up into recognisably different regional dialects. A hundred years after
the anonymous chronicler of the Morea had broken new ground by writing
in a form of Greek that resembles the language of Greece today, Leontios
Machairas in Cyprus began to write the history of his native island, in prose
this time, and in a form of the dialect that still marks out Greek Cypriots
from other Greeks.22
Machairas was an Orthodox subject of the Lusignan kings. By his own
account, he had served as secretary to a local member of the French
nobility. In July 1426, when King Janus Lusignan was preparing to defend
Cyprus against a Mamluk force that had landed from Egypt on the south
coast, Machairas found himself in charge of the provision of wine for the
defending army. The battle that followed, at a place called Choirokoitia, on
the road that leads inland from Limassol on the coast to Nicosia, the capital,
marks a climactic point in the narrative that he would soon afterwards begin
to write. The king was taken prisoner, his army was routed, and towns were
pillaged. Once the invaders had left, the Greek-speaking Orthodox subjects
of the kingdom rebelled. But the king returned after a ransom was raised for
his release. The pretender Alexios, who had raised the standard of revolt,
was executed on the same day. Writing of these events during the reign of
Janus’s son, John II Lusignan, Machairas is clear about where his loyalties
lie. The native Greek rebels had been ‘accursed peasants’, their actions
‘evil’; their leader, the self-proclaimed ‘King Alexios’, only merits a few
lines in his narrative. For the historian writing in Cypriot Greek, the
Lusignan kings are the guarantors of stability and the best interests of their
subjects. Whenever there is dissension or rebellion, he comes down on the
side of the king.23
But the word Machairas uses for ‘king’ is a recently coined one in Greek
—regas, derived from the Latin rex. The older Greek title, basileus, he

reserves for the emperor in Constantinople. By the time that Machairas was
writing, the days of the imperial capital were already numbered; the
Orthodox king-emperor (basileus) had precious little empire left to rule. But
the historian writes with wistful respect of this remnant of an old order
whose day is almost done. Just as the Chronicle of the Morea created a new
category of people called ‘Moreots’, so Machairas, for the first time on the
historical record, speaks consistently and with evident solidarity of
‘Cypriots’. Quite clearly, these Cypriots are made up of both rulers and
ruled.24 It was the Cypriots, collectively and all together, who had suffered
defeat and humiliation on the battlefield of Choirokoitia in July 1426—
from King Janus Lusignan and his French-speaking knights, down past their
wine steward and future chronicler, all the way through the ranks to the
Greek-speaking peasants who would rebel in the aftermath. In its own way,
although very different from the shorter-lived ‘Principality of Achaea’ in
the Peloponnese, the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem, by the middle of
the fifteenth century, had progressed even farther down a comparable
evolutionary path.
These developments in different corners of the Greek-speaking world
were perhaps not so very different from the gradual amalgam of peoples,
cultures, and languages that a little earlier had been completed in England,
two and three centuries after the Norman conquest of 1066. The Morea and
Cyprus are the best documented examples of this process at work in the
Greek-speaking world. But they are not the only ones.25 And the process
would not be exhausted even by the fifteenth century. The most hopeful
monster of them all, Venetian Crete in its heyday, was still some way in the
future.
All this time, the little that was left of the Byzantine Empire was steadily
whittled away. In 1347, the Black Death ravaged Constantinople on its way
westwards to wipe out as much as a third of the population of western
Europe. By then, only a handful of towns, islands, and disconnected
stretches of coastline remained under Byzantine control. Almost the whole
of today’s Greece was divided between Latins in the south and an expanded
Serbian kingdom that had taken control of most of the north.
Constantinople, with its Thracian hinterland, was once again in effect just

another city-state, distinguished only by its massive city walls and an
exaggerated sense of its own importance. But the truth was that the ‘queen
of cities’ now lagged far behind Venice or Genoa in military or commercial
strength.
The diminished nature of the prize proved no bar to rival candidates who
on several occasions mustered armies to fight for the imperial title. In 1346,
no fewer than three self-proclaimed ‘emperors of the Romans’ reigned
simultaneously. That struggle ended in 1347 with a victory for John VI
Kantakouzenos over the supporters of the underage John V Palaiologos,
that would prove pyrrhic. When the new emperor was crowned in
Constantinople on 21 May, the crown and the jewels in which he was
invested were cheap fakes, because the real ones had been pawned to
Venice by the opposite faction four years before. They would never be
returned. Even Hagia Sophia was in such a state of disrepair that the
coronation could not be held there, but in a church next to the Blacherna
palace.26
Worse was to come. For several decades, now, successive emperors had
tried to exploit the divisions among their neighbours to the east and south,
the Turkish emirates. If there was no longer any serious prospect of
regaining territory lost in Asia, Turkish troops could still be hired as
mercenaries. One emir would be recruited as a tactical ally to help weaken a
rival. John Kantakouzenos enjoyed a particularly warm relationship with
Orhan, son of Osman, the emir of Bithynia, and had even given him his
daughter in marriage. Orhan’s territory included the entire southern coast of
the Sea of Marmara, which meant that his emirate was the closest of all to
Constantinople. The emperor could not know to what heights the Osmanli,
or Ottoman, dynasty would rise in times to come. But he should perhaps not
have been surprised when, the next time he summoned Turkish mercenaries
across the Hellespont to Gallipoli, to help him in a renewed bout of civil
war in 1352, Orhan’s son Suleiman simply refused to go home afterwards.
Suleiman’s occupation of a number of small towns on the Gallipoli
peninsula in that year marks the first permanent Turkish settlement on
European soil.
John VI Kantakouzenos, dubbed the ‘reluctant emperor’ by his only
modern biographer, had unwittingly paid a high price for his ascendancy. It

would bring him very little gain, either, as he would shortly afterwards bow
to pressure and abdicate in favour of the rival he had previously defeated,
John V Palaiologos.27 By the end of the century, the Ottomans had moved
their capital from Bursa on the Asian shore of the Sea of Marmara to
Adrianople in Thrace, and they had overrun the kingdoms of both Bulgaria
and Serbia. Constantinople itself was placed under siege by the Ottoman
ruler, Bayezid, who had in the meantime been elevated to the title of Sultan,
in 1394.
Faced with these pressures, whole sections of Byzantine society, and
individuals in a position to do so, turned in contradictory directions in a
desperate search for solutions. One initiative came from monks and
monasteries. During the fourteenth century, a movement began which
combined mystical contemplation with private prayer and an attitude of
resignation towards the things of the world. Hesychasm, as the movement
became known, at least superficially shares common elements with the Sufi
tradition in Islam, and in today’s terms with yoga and Transcendental
Meditation. The word means more or less ‘the art of stillness’. In a world in
which the political order was visibly failing, it could make sense to
withdraw as far as possible. But politically, hesychasm was bound to breed
a form of resignation, bordering on fatalism.28
A very different approach came from those more pragmatic members of
the Byzantine ruling class who still pinned their hopes on saving the state.
This was to work for a diplomatic compromise with the western church in
return for military reinforcement from the west. To this end, in the course of
a long reign after the abdication of his rival, John V Palaiologos paid a
humiliating visit to the pope in Rome. He arrived there in October 1369 and
stayed five months. The upshot was that the most a Byzantine emperor
could promise was a purely personal submission to the authority of the
pope. Whether from conviction, or more likely from a desperate attempt at
expediency, John V was received into the Latin church. In ecclesiastical
terms it was too little because he could not even pretend to bring the clergy
of his own church along with him, as his predecessor Michael VIII had tried
to do almost a century before. And strategically, even if he had been able to
offer more, by this time there were limits to the power of a pope to mobilise

a crusade in the way that Pope Urban had done back in the 1090s. So
nothing practical came from John’s mission to Rome.29
His son and successor, Manuel II, tried a different tack. Manuel set out for
the west in December 1399. The siege of his capital by Bayezid’s forces
had still not been lifted. There had never been a more critical moment if the
last bastion of Christendom in the east was to be saved. Manuel wasted no
time with popes or ecclesiastical councils, and for once held out no
promises of an elusive unification of the churches. Described as ‘an urbane
and scholarly man with a finer and more commanding presence than his
father’, this emperor traversed Europe to pitch his appeal for military
support directly to Charles VI of France and Henry IV of England.
In the course of a tour that lasted three years, Manuel was received with
honour in London at the end of 1400 and entertained to Christmas dinner
and a tournament at Eltham Palace. Less than eighteen months had passed
since Henry had deposed his predecessor, Richard II, and taken the crown
for himself—a far less common occurrence in England than it was in
Byzantium. Manuel would have been overjoyed to learn that his host had
every intention of leading a crusade to the east, probably not realising that
Henry was only hoping to distract attention from his own illegitimacy so as
to quell dissent at home. In the event, as every student of Shakespeare and
English history knows, Henry IV would spend the rest of his reign fighting
civil wars in his own kingdom, while his son Henry V would direct his
efforts against neighbouring France. Despite the raised hopes of Manuel,
the crusading spirit in this corner of western Europe was dead.30
As things turned out, the reprieve for what was left of the Byzantine
Empire came not from the west but from the east. In July 1402, while
Manuel was still in Paris, in a battle fought outside Ankara in July 1402, a
Mongol army led by Timur-lenk, known in English as Tamburlaine,
defeated the Ottomans and took Sultan Bayezid prisoner. For the time
being, the Turks were at the mercy of the Mongols. In Europe, and
particularly in Constantinople, it looked as though the Ottoman state was
about to fall apart, as the Seljuk sultanate had done before it. The effect,
instead, was to grant the Byzantines another fifty years to argue among
themselves about the means to their salvation.31

So far, at least explicitly, there had been only two broad strategies on the
table—the one designed to uphold the integrity of the Orthodox Church; the
other directed towards preserving the state and its institutions. But in the
second decade of the fifteenth century came for the first time an explicit and
highly articulate plea for a part of that state to go it alone, and in a way that
was unprecedented in all the earlier Byzantine centuries. It originated from
a provincial centre that had been steadily regaining ground during the past
hundred years. This was the Morea, or Peloponnese. The Frankish
Principate of Achaea was long gone. By 1430, the whole of the
Peloponnese was once again in Byzantine hands. But in the spirit of the
times, the ‘Despotate of the Morea’, as it was known, was ruled not directly
from Constantinople but from the provincial capital at Mystra, the medieval
town built on a steep hilltop overlooking the Eurotas valley and the longabandoned site of ancient Sparta. The ‘despot’ was appointed by the
emperor, usually from among his closest relatives, but was able to exercise
a good deal of autonomy on the ground.32
Throughout the first half of the fifteenth century, the court at Mystra
functioned as a political and cultural centre in its own right. The traces of
this can still be seen in the ruined palaces and churches, some of them now
restored, that rise in terraces punctuated by winding streets that afford
sudden glimpses of the olive groves of Laconia in one direction and the
rocky peaks of the Taygetos range in the other. It was here that one of the
most brilliant and original thinkers of the day, George Gemistos, who
preferred to be known by the name of Plethon, came up with nothing less
than an entirely new way for Greeks to reinvent themselves in the new
conditions of the time.
Not much is known for certain about Plethon’s life. He was born shortly
before 1360, probably in Constantinople; he enjoyed the benefits of a
Byzantine education at the highest level and went on to occupy a number of
administrative positions, first in the capital, and then, from about 1400
onwards, at Mystra. Today, Plethon is best remembered for his attempt to
rehabilitate the ideas of the ancient philosopher Plato, whose name he
seems deliberately to echo in the choice of his own, and for his later
influence on the Italian Renaissance. But the political programme he set out
in two memoranda, one addressed to Despot Theodore II in Mystra and the

other to the despot’s father, Manuel II Palaiologos in Constantinople, was
also deeply grounded in the political realities of the Peloponnese at the time
when he wrote them (probably between 1416 and 1418).
The Morea, Plethon argued, is large enough and fertile enough to produce
enough for the needs of its people. Separated from the mainland except for
the narrow Isthmus of Corinth, it is ‘simultaneously an island and a
continent’ and ‘with minimal preparation has adequate means to defend
itself’. Moreover, ‘It appears that this land has always been inhabited by
Hellenes, who have been the same for as long as humans can recollect’. As
Plethon put it to the emperor in an often-quoted line: ‘We whom you lead
and over whom you rule are Hellenes by descent, as our language and our
traditional education bear witness.’33
This was to reverse the terms that had been used by Plato’s contemporary
Isocrates almost two thousand years before, in 380 BCE, and all but
universally accepted ever since: that it was language and education, rather
than ancestry, that defined a person as Greek. In Plethon’s formulation,
language and education are still there, but ‘descent’, or kinship group
(genos in Greek, the same word that Isocrates had used), now takes first
place. Byzantines before Plethon had very occasionally revived the old term
‘Hellenes’ to describe themselves, but never as seriously as this. Plethon’s
blueprint for the Morea in many ways anticipates the concept of national
identity as it would develop in much of Europe in later centuries.34
Having established the case for a ‘Hellenic’ Morea, self-sufficient and
effectively independent of Constantinople, Plethon went on to set out
detailed proposals to reform its administration along lines derived from
Plato. Some of this sounds distinctly totalitarian by our standards today.
Plethon was an admirer not only of Plato but also of the ancient counterpart
to Mystra, the corporate state of Sparta that had once flourished in the
valley below. Private land, he writes to the emperor, is to be confiscated and
redistributed to those most able and willing to cultivate it. Plethon reserves
some of his harshest criticism for monasteries and monks (‘a swarm of
drones’). Their wealth and the privileges accorded to them (this is also a
sideswipe at the influence of hesychasm) uselessly drain the resources that
should be available to the state and in this way benefit only the Turkish
enemy.35

In political terms, Plethon’s proposal for the governance of the
Peloponnese was by a long way the strangest of all the evolutionary dead
ends, or hopeful monsters, thrown up by these centuries. But this one only
ever existed on paper. Neither Despot Theodore nor Emperor Manuel took
any notice. In his later years, released from the pragmatic necessity of
persuading an imperial patron to adopt and implement his ideas, Plethon
would extend his theoretical blueprint even beyond politics. His last book,
the Laws, would be discovered after his death in the early 1450s. It seems
that he had shared its contents only with a close circle of trusted friends and
pupils at Mystra. In the Laws, Plethon parts company not only with the
Byzantine Empire but with Christianity too, to propose a return to
worshipping the ancient Greek gods, rather as Julian the Apostate had done
a little over a millennium before. But this most radical experiment of all
didn’t even survive on paper—except for a few tantalising passages,
preserved only so as to show how heinous it was. The manuscript itself was
publicly burned on the orders of the patriarch of the Orthodox Church.
By the second half of the 1430s, the survival of Constantinople once again
hung by a thread. On the throne was Manuel’s son, John VIII Palaiologos.
The only policy left to the Byzantine state to pursue was a full union
between the churches. Even that might not succeed, and the emperor and
his advisers were well aware of the strength of opposition at all levels of the
Orthodox faithful. Everything seemed to be coming together when Pope
Eugenius IV agreed to a long-standing Byzantine precondition that had
never previously been met: only a council of the whole Christian church,
with eastern and western branches fully represented, could finally settle the
terms of union. Not on the table, of course, was the supremacy of the
papacy. That would have to be conceded.
In March 1438, a delegation some seven hundred strong representing the
entire Orthodox communion arrived in the northern Italian city of Ferrara
for the promised ecumenical council. It was headed by the emperor and the
patriarch. All the intellectual and ecclesiastical luminaries of
Constantinople, its outlying territories, and the Despotate of the Morea
seem to have been present. Plethon, now well into his eighties, was
dutifully among them—even though secretly, in all probability, he had

already turned his back on both the contending parties. The council dragged
on at Ferrara until an outbreak of plague in the city forced a move to
Florence instead. A modern historian describes ‘trained theologians on
either side of the debate, brandishing their bones of contention with all the
passionate intensity of obsessed academics’.36
Eventually, the formal union of the churches was proclaimed in Florence
on 6 July 1439. The quid pro quo was that Pope Eugenius would now
announce a crusade to save Constantinople from the Turks. And despite the
changed political climate in Europe, an expedition did in fact set out, five
years later. The Crusade of Varna would turn out to be the last. An
expedition recruited from Burgundy and Venice in the west and from
Serbia, Hungary, and Wallachia in the east was ignominiously crushed near
the town of that name, on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, on 10 November
1444. The hope of some form of western military support for the
Byzantines had not quite vanished. But there was little chance, now, of
intervention on a comparable scale again. Constantinople stood alone.37
Two things made it inevitable, as the decade of the 1450s began, that the
‘city of the world’s desire’ would fall to the Ottomans: geography and
gunpowder. Ottoman rule already extended through much of the Balkans,
reaching hundreds of miles to the west and north on the European mainland.
Protected by its immense walls, Constantinople was an island entirely
encircled by an enemy intent on conquest. The walls that had been built in
the reign of Theodosius II in the early fifth century had stood against any
and every kind of assault for a thousand years. Provided only that the
Byzantines kept control of the waterways that surrounded them and could
keep an enemy out of the safe harbour of the Golden Horn, their city was
impregnable. It had been taken only twice before: in 1204 after the
Venetians had forced a way for their ships inside the Golden Horn, and then
in 1261 while it had been practically undefended, allowing Michael VIII to
oust the last Latin emperor.
But the young and determined Ottoman sultan, Mehmed II, known ever
since in Turkish as Fatih, ‘the Conqueror’, had a new weapon. Once upon a
time, the Byzantines had been ahead in military technology: the mysterious
‘Greek fire’ had saved them on numerous occasions in the past. This time,

they had been left behind. Gunpowder, originally from China but now
combined with the technology of cannon that the Ottomans had imported
from the Christian west, became the clinching factor. As Mehmed
assembled his forces in the autumn of 1452, fifth-century defences were up
against the newest and most deadly invention of the fifteenth.
The final siege began on 6 April 1453. It was the week after Easter. Daily,
Turkish cannon bombarded the walls. In overall command of the defence
was Constantine XI Palaiologos. Forty-eight years old (more than twice the
age of his adversary, Mehmed), Constantine had served his elder brother
John VIII ably as Despot of the Morea before becoming emperor in 1449.
The last ‘emperor of the Romans’ had received his title and regalia in
Mystra but would never be formally crowned in his own capital. So visceral
was the opposition of the Orthodox clergy to the union of the churches that
no patriarch could be found to perform the age-old ceremony in Hagia
Sophia. Indicative of the attitude of many among the defenders was the
often-quoted assertion attributed to one of Constantine’s senior
commanders, which may well be apocryphal: ‘better a Turkish turban than a
popish mitre’.38
Despite this, the defence of the city was reinforced by contingents from
Genoa and Venice. A war fleet from Venice was eagerly awaited. But by
mid-May, a vessel that had broken the siege to reconnoitre returned to
report that none was on the way. An official, sent to make a tally of the
fighting men present in the city, would later record that he had personally
counted 4,773 imperial soldiers and 200 foreigners. Other sources put the
number of the defenders at somewhere between six and seven thousand,
facing an Ottoman army at least eighty thousand strong.39
On 21 May, Mehmed sent an embassy offering terms of surrender. If it
had been accepted, it would have saved the city from the traditional three
days of plunder and massacre. Constantine rejected it out of hand. A final
vigil was held in Hagia Sophia on the night of Monday the twenty-eighth.
For once, everyone who could be spared from duty on the defences took
part, Latins and Orthodox alike. The Turkish assault began before dawn the
next day. The walls had been seriously weakened by weeks of cannon fire.
Now, under cover of the Turkish guns, wave after wave of the Ottoman elite
force, the janissaries, charged forward. By the time the sun rose, the first of

them had scaled the ramparts. For hours there was hand-to-hand fighting
inside the city. Many of the Venetians and Genoese managed to escape on
their ships. The city’s inhabitants were left to their fate. Constantine himself
was last seen fighting on the ramparts among the common soldiers. His
body was never found. Later, the legend would circulate that the ‘immortal
emperor’ had been spirited away by an angel to a secret place deep within
the city walls and turned to stone, there to await the moment when he will
emerge in triumph and reclaim Constantinople for the Orthodox faithful.40
Once the city had been taken, the killing and looting began. Some four
thousand of the city’s inhabitants were probably cut down during the first
twelve hours. As many as fifty thousand may have been taken as slaves. By
early afternoon, Mehmed entered the city in a ceremonial procession.
According to a Venetian eye witness, the sultan rode a white horse, while
‘blood flowed through the streets like rainwater after a sudden storm’. The
procession made its way at once to Hagia Sophia, where the Christian
liturgy had been celebrated for the last time the night before. A priest went
up into the pulpit and chanted the Muslim call to prayer.41 Justinian’s great
cathedral of eastern Christianity, that had already stood for the best part of a
millennium, had now become the greatest mosque in the Muslim world.
From a Greek point of view, the second sack of Constantinople in 1453 is
often seen as the culmination of a process of dissolution that had been set in
motion by the crusaders and Venetians two and a half centuries before. But
from a broader perspective, the consequence of the Ottoman conquest was
actually to reverse that process. The imperial centre had been progressively
sidelined from the late twelfth century onwards, as the Greek-speaking
world fell apart, and the rump Byzantine Empire found itself increasingly
left high and dry by the tide of history. Of all the speculative new political
projects, or hopeful monsters, that had sprung up from small beginnings
during the chaos of the thirteenth century, the one that finally made it to
dominate the human ecology of the whole region turned out to have been
the tiny emirate founded in Bithynia by Osman, that had been nurtured—
and exploited—for his own ends by the Byzantine emperor John VI
Kantakouzenos back in the 1340s and 1350s. Osman’s descendant Mehmed
II, by his conquest, simply restored Constantinople to its former position,

under the new name of Istanbul, as the capital city of a world empire, as it
would remain for the best part of the next five hundred years.

BETWEEN TWO WORLDS
1453–1669

A

fter the loss of Constantinople, Greeks remained in charge of their own

destinies only in the Despotate of the Morea, with its capital at Mystra, and
in the ‘Empire of Trebizond’ at the far end of the Black Sea. Mehmed
wasted no time in mopping up these last outposts. Mystra fell in 1460,
Trebizond the year after. For the next three hundred years, everyone who
spoke Greek as a first language would be a subject of either the Ottoman
sultan or a western European, and usually Roman Catholic, administration.
For most, it wasn’t a matter of choice but of where you happened to live.
For those who did opt to leave the land of their birth, and had the means to
do so, the choice was stark.
Survivors of the imperial family and the Byzantine elite fled westwards to
Italy, often by way of Crete or other islands that were still under Latin rule.
But despite occasional heady talk of renewed crusades against the Turks,
there was never any prospect of a political revival for the Byzantine Empire
on foreign soil. The last emperor had died childless. The final descendant of
the Palaiologoi with a legitimate claim to the Byzantine throne would wind
up penniless in Rome. Having nothing else to live on, he would surrender
all his titles, first to the king of France, and then to the Catholic Monarchs
Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castile. Not even this would be
enough to save Andreas Palaiologos from dying in poverty in Spain in
1502.1 The Greeks who would make their mark on western Europe during
the decades after the fall of Constantinople were not soldiers or political
leaders but scholars and men of learning. Through these fugitives,

Byzantium, at the last, would bequeath to the rest of the world its highly
prized system of education that was still based on a thorough knowledge of
Homer and the classic Greek authors of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE.
This was the gateway through which knowledge of the Greek language and
access to ancient Greek thought returned to western Europe after an absence
of almost a thousand years.

The ground had been well prepared, not least during informal encounters
that had taken place on the fringe of the church council in Ferrara and
Florence back in 1438 and 1439. More lasting in its effects than any of the
council’s resolutions would prove to be a series of fringe encounters
between individuals on the opposing sides. The maverick ideas of a Plethon
or the manuscripts of ancient Greek history, poetry, and philosophy
assembled by Plethon’s pupil Bessarion, who would go on to become a
cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, would prove to be of more interest
in intellectual Italian circles at the time than any amount of argument about
the procession of the Holy Spirit.
This was because, for some time before this, enquiring minds in Italy had
been seeking out the lost or forgotten arts and ideas of antiquity. The
intellectual and artistic movement that reached its peak during the decades
after the fall of Constantinople is now known as the Renaissance.2 Naturally
enough, the rediscovery had begun with ancient Rome. But as soon as
Italians once again were reading and rereading ancient Roman authors such
as Cicero, it became obvious how much they, in their turn, had learned from
the Greeks. If the ancient Romans had been ‘held captive’ (in the oftenquoted line of the poet Horace, in the first century CE) by the Greek
civilisation they had conquered, so too could Italians, a millennium and a
half later.
Elite immigrants from Constantinople or Mystra, steeped in the classical
Greek education they had acquired there, were eagerly made welcome by
their Italian hosts. The city-states of the Italian peninsula were, after all,
republics. Just like the ancient Greek poleis, they were constantly in a state
of war against one another. Their leaders were more than ever preoccupied
with the questions of governance and civic responsibility that had first been
debated in the ancient Greek city-states and had found a permanent record
in the pages of Plato and Aristotle. Italians, and in due course other
Europeans, too, were avid to find out firsthand what these long-lost
treasures, hitherto known only through summaries and comments preserved
in Latin, had to say on issues that were pressing in their own time and place.
In this way was born the political philosophy now conventionally known by
the name of ‘civic humanism’—a very specific legacy of the ancient Greek
polis, that came via the Italian Renaissance to the modern world.3

During the second half of the fifteenth century, university chairs in Greek
began to proliferate at Italian universities. Many of the first and second
generations of professors were Greek émigrés—provided they were willing
to part company with their own Orthodox Church and adopt Roman
Catholicism. In Rome, Pope Nicholas V began to establish a collection of
Greek manuscripts in the Vatican Library in 1448; for the rest of the
century, Rome would become a centre of Greek scholarship, attracting
many more high-profile Byzantine converts. These highly educated
migrants can never have been very numerous. Nor were they the
originators of the Renaissance; they were more like a catalyst that made it
possible. And essential though their contribution undoubtedly was, what
counted with their hosts was their knowledge of the ancient language and
its treasures, from the poems of Homer and Hesiod down to the sermons of
the Fathers of the Church, written in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Few
western Europeans in the fifteenth century wanted to learn to speak the
Greek of their own time, still fewer to learn about the recent past or future
prospects of the communities their teachers had left behind.
On the other hand, the impact of these teachers and the learning that they
brought with them went well beyond secular scholarship and the arts.
Before long, the skills acquired through a humanist education, and
particularly the knowledge of Greek, would exercise a profound influence
on the course of Christianity in the west. For the first time in many
centuries, churchmen in western Europe could learn to read the original
Greek text of the New Testament. Erasmus of Rotterdam, one of the leading
figures in the Protestant Reformation in the early sixteenth century, had
studied Greek at the University of Padua. This was what enabled Erasmus
and others to challenge the authority of the ‘Vulgate’, the Latin translation
of the Bible on which the western church had always had to rely. After that,
it was not long before Protestants were translating the Christian scriptures
directly from Greek and Hebrew into the modern languages of Europe—
and the full fury of the Reformation, the Catholic Counter-Reformation, and
Europe’s ‘wars of religion’ would be unleashed.
In a very different sphere, among the newly rediscovered books translated
from Greek was the Geography of Strabo, that had been written in the first
century CE. It was from two passages in this work that the Genoese
explorer Christopher Columbus learned that it must be possible to sail

westwards from Europe to reach India, at least if we accept the later
testimony of his son. Ironically enough, according to the Byzantine system
of reckoning historical time, the year 1492, when Columbus made his first
voyage across the Atlantic, would have marked the end of the seventh
millennium since the Creation. Generations of Orthodox Christians had
been brought up to believe that the Last Judgement and the end of the world
would come about in the year 7000.4 In Constantinople, the apocalypse had
been premature, but only by a matter of a few decades. As one world ended,
another was about to begin. Just at the time when the political selfdetermination of Greek speakers had been extinguished in their own lands,
an outward movement was beginning that would spread their language,
together with the ideas that had once been expressed in it, not just to the rest
of Europe but right around the world.
For the vast majority, though, the realities of daily life meant accepting the
new conditions in which they found themselves. One of these was peace.
Ever since the Byzantine Empire had begun to break up two and half
centuries before, wars had been fought more or less continually in most of
its former territories. Some modern historians speak of a pax ottomanica,
the equivalent of the pax romana that had once been imposed by Rome. The
Ottoman state was Islamic and theocratic, but at the time of the conquest,
Muslims still made up only a minority of its subjects. Ways had to be found
to bind the subject Orthodox population into the new status quo.
Constantinople had been a ghost city when Mehmed first declared it his
imperial capital. Almost at once, he set about repopulating it. It seems to
have been a deliberate policy to import Greek families, forcibly moved
from other conquered regions, so as to fill the empty streets and houses.
Twenty-five years after the conquest, almost a third of the city’s
approximately sixty thousand inhabitants were Orthodox Greeks. This was
a far cry from the heyday in the time of Justinian, when it had been home to
some four hundred thousand. But it was a start. And as the city grew over
the centuries to come, so would the number of Greek-speaking Orthodox
Christians.5
The contrast is often drawn between the apparent tolerance of the
Ottomans towards their non-Muslim subjects and the religious persecutions

that were notorious in the west at this time and for long afterwards. There
was to be no equivalent, as the Ottoman Empire expanded, to the expulsion
of Jews and Muslims from the Iberian peninsula after the last Muslim
kingdom in Spain fell in 1492, or to the excesses of the Holy Office, or
Inquisition, in Catholic Europe during the centuries that followed. Matters
of private conscience were of no interest to the Ottoman authorities—any
more than they had once been to the Romans back in the early years of
Christianity. What mattered was loyalty to the state. Mehmed’s
masterstroke was to turn the Orthodox Church into an institution of the
Islamic Ottoman Empire.
His choice for the man to run it was a monk by the name of Gennadios
Scholarios. Known as an outspoken critic of the Latins and a leading figure
among those Byzantine clergy who had stood out against the abortive union
of the churches, Scholarios could be expected to steer the Orthodox faithful
away from any lingering nostalgia for the rival religious authority of the
papacy or for military interference from the west. It had taken some trouble
to find him, because the monks of his monastery had already been sold off
as slaves. Eventually, Mehmed’s agents ran him to earth where he was
working in a household in Edirne and brought him back to Constantinople.
There, Scholarios was duly invested by the sultan as Gennadios II,
Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, according to the ritual that
had been performed by Byzantine emperors for centuries.
From that time on, the highest office of the Christian church in the
Ottoman state would be in the personal gift of the sultan. The arrangement
was as much as anything a financial one: the patriarch and his officials were
given responsibility for the collection and payment of taxes by the Christian
community (a role that of course they had never been called on to fill
before). Given how numerous were the sultan’s Christian subjects, this was
a far more lucrative proposition than persecution would have been. These
policies had little to do with what a later age would term tolerance.
Mehmed had made a political calculation. And it worked. As early as 1466,
the sultan was being addressed in Greek by the old Byzantine title of
‘Basileus of the Romans’. And at about the same time, Kritovoulos of
Imbros, one of the last Greek historians to write in the Byzantine tradition,

flattered his new sovereign by comparing him favourably to ‘Alexander the
Macedonian’.6
On the other hand, there was no getting away from the fact that Greeks, in
common with all other non-Muslims, were second-class citizens. They had
to pay discriminatory taxes. An institution that was much feared by
Christian families throughout the rural districts of the empire’s European
provinces was the notorious devshirme. This was a regular levy that
forcibly removed Christian male children from their homes to be converted
to Islam. Forbidden to marry, they would be pressed into a lifetime of
service in the elite corps of janissaries. Not all of these recruits ended up as
soldiers. Some would be selected for high-ranking positions in the civil
administration or the personal service of the sultan. In this way, for all its
arbitrary cruelty, the system did bring spectacular opportunities to some of
the poorest of the empire’s subjects. And paradoxically, the devshirme
could not have existed without the Christian communities to keep it
supplied with young recruits. At an early stage, Ottoman administrators had
concluded that these converts, who by definition could have no family
loyalties to compete with their loyalty to the sultan, would be more
trustworthy than the high-born Muslims who vied with one another for
status at the imperial court.7
These were some of the mechanisms that enabled Greek-speaking
communities, and therefore the Greek language, to survive in their
homelands after the Ottoman conquest. But inevitably, the initiative lay
with the conquerors. Greeks themselves had no say. This is why it is not
enough to repeat the commonly heard assertion that Greeks were held
together during the centuries of Ottoman rule by their language and their
church. Yes, they were—but only because the political self-interest of the
Ottoman state made it possible. The fate of the Jews and Muslims of Spain
is a stark reminder of what could have been.
That said, Greek individuals and whole communities were not slow to
make the most of the opportunities that the system allowed them. One route
to preferment was always conversion, whether forced, as in the case of the
devshirme, or voluntary. And some Greek converts to Islam could become
very powerful within the Ottoman state. Before the end of the fifteenth
century, at least two grand viziers (a role roughly equivalent to the sultan’s

prime minister) had started out as members of the Byzantine elite before the
conquest.8 But in most areas of the empire, and certainly in the capital,
those who converted would soon be lost to the Greek language. It was as
Christians that Greeks continued to be a visible and fully accepted presence
in the Ottoman Empire. Non-Muslims could be employed in many different
roles, without being expected to convert. Ottoman armies, for instance,
recruited large numbers of Orthodox Greeks and allowed them the
privileges that went with their rank. This meant that, over the years,
probably as many Greek speakers fought within the Ottoman ranks as
fought against them in the armies of western-ruled Christian states.9
For several centuries after the conquest, there was little sign of Greek
resistance or active defiance. Revolts were rare, local, and swiftly put down.
Even the phenomenon of ‘neo-martyrs’—Christians who refused to convert
and who died for their faith, as the early Christian martyrs had once done—
was small in scale, though their stories also bear harrowing witness to the
brutality of Ottoman punishments. More often than not, the victims were
former Christians who had at first given in to pressure and converted to
Islam and later reverted—thereby calling upon themselves the traditional
Islamic penalty for apostasy.10 For the great majority of Greeks who were
Ottoman subjects throughout the sixteenth century and beyond, it made
sense to find an accommodation with an empire that was vigorously
expanding in all directions, gobbling up both Muslim and Christian states in
its seemingly unstoppable progress.
During the reign of Selim I, between 1512 and 1520, the Ottomans
defeated the Mamluk rulers of Syria and Egypt, extended their power right
through the Arabian Peninsula as far as Yemen, took control of the Muslim
holy sites of Mecca and Medina, and made inroads against the newly
established Safavid dynasty of Persia. The Ottoman sultan was in a position
to claim the title of Caliph, the supreme ruler over Muslims, wherever they
might live. The next sultan, Süleyman I, was poised to inherit all the riches
that came with control of the trade routes of the Mediterranean and the
Middle East and would extend the empire’s conquests even farther afield.
Remembered in the west as ‘the Magnificent’ and by Muslims as ‘the

Lawgiver’, Süleyman pushed farther into the European continent and
farther west into the Mediterranean than any sultan had done before him.
Belgrade fell in 1521, followed by much of Hungary and today’s
Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine. In 1529, Süleyman’s forces laid siege to
Vienna, though the Habsburg capital would prove to be a prize too far. In
the meantime, in the Greek-speaking world, the Knights Hospitaller of
Saint John had been forced to surrender their stronghold on the island of
Rhodes in 1522. During the next two decades, the Ottoman fleet for the first
time outstripped that of Venice, to become the strongest in the
Mediterranean. By 1540, almost all the islands of the Aegean were under
Ottoman control. Then in 1565, the fleet laid siege to Malta, the new
headquarters of the Knights of Saint John, but failed to take it. Süleyman
died the next year on an abortive campaign into Hungary. Even if Ottoman
power was no longer quite invincible, Süleyman’s forces still managed to
take the island of Chios from the Genoese in the spring of 1566.11
That left the ‘Most Serene Republic of Venice’ as the only rival to the
Ottomans in the eastern Mediterranean. Venice had acquired control of
Cyprus when the last Lusignan king died in 1489, leaving his kingdom to
his widow, who happened to be a Venetian. Since then, the chief bulwarks
of Venetian power abroad had been Cyprus and Crete. It was on Cyprus that
the next sultan, Selim II, set his sights. In the summer of 1570, a massive
Ottoman force landed on the south coast of the island, not far from today’s
Larnaca. The capital, Nicosia, was besieged and sacked in September. A
Venetian garrison held out in Famagusta for almost a year longer, but soon
the whole island was in Ottoman hands. For the local Greeks, there was
gain as well as loss from the change of masters: one of the first acts of the
new Ottoman administration was to abolish the Catholic hierarchy and
allow the Orthodox Church to appoint its own bishops again. This was a
calculated policy, and it was applied wherever the Ottomans supplanted a
Catholic administration: the Catholic church they saw, not wrongly, as a
political arm of the papacy and the powerful courts of western Europe,
while the Orthodox hierarchy was under their own control.12
In the battle for Cyprus in 1570 and 1571, there must have been many
Greeks in arms fighting on both sides. This would be the case once again
only a few months after the fall of Famagusta, when the Ottoman fleet came

up against the combined ships of Venice, Spain, and the Papal States at the
entrance to the Gulf of Patras, off the fortified town of Nafpaktos, also
known by the Italian name of Lepanto. The Ottoman fleet, 230 galleys
strong, was almost completely destroyed. The battle of Lepanto, fought on
7 October 1571, can be seen in hindsight as the decisive turning point that
halted the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Europe by sea.13 But from
the point of view of most Greeks, it merely consolidated a reality that their
parents and grandparents had been living with for more than a century.
After 1571, apart from isolated coastal garrison towns, the only places left
where Greeks still lived under western, Venetian rule were the Ionian
Islands off the west coast of the Greek mainland and Crete. And it is only
after the loss to the Venetians of Cyprus that the story of Venetian Crete
really comes into its own.
Crete was a late developer among the hybrid cultures, or hopeful monsters,
that had sprung up in the wake of the Fourth Crusade. This was because
Venice had begun by imposing a strictly colonial system on its overseas
possessions. Policy was made and directed from the metropolitan centre.
The highest officials, including the Provveditore Generale, who reported
directly to the Venetian Senate, were sent out for tours of duty that lasted
only two years at a time. In the beginning, land, property, and privileges in
Crete had been handed out to settlers who belonged to Venetian noble
families. A rigid separation had been created between these Venetian nobles
and the native Cretans of all classes, including the local aristocracy who
claimed descent from a nobility that went back to Byzantine times. And at
least in theory, this segregation would be maintained for several centuries,
based on the religious divide. The very rigidity of the system fuelled a
series of rebellions, and these continued into the sixteenth century. All of
them were put down with a ferocity more usually associated in Greek
collective memory with the Ottoman Turks. But their effect over time was
to win some limited concessions from the Venetian authorities for the
Orthodox population.14
Even in such a polarised society, and despite repeated efforts emanating
from Venice, the permanent settlers soon began to ‘go native’.
Intermarriage between Venetians and the local aristocracy was frequent.

Although those on the highest rungs of the social ladder were obliged to
reaffirm their Catholic faith in each generation as a condition of renewing
their titles, many minor branches of the same families soon quietly adopted
Orthodoxy, or at least reached an easy accommodation with the majority
religion. This came the more naturally because everyone who lived
permanently in Crete had taken to speaking Greek within a few generations
after the Venetians’ arrival in 1211. In Crete, as elsewhere during those
centuries, a regional dialect soon began to diverge from the Greek spoken
elsewhere, in this case incorporating words and some characteristic sounds
from the Italian spoken in Venice.15 By the middle of the fifteenth century,
poets were cultivating a written form of their regional dialect of Greek as a
medium for sophisticated literary expression, the equivalent of Dante’s
Italian, Chaucer’s English, or the Spanish of Cervantes.
The decisive change came around the middle of the sixteenth century. The
threat from the Ottoman Turks was growing. After the fall of Cyprus, it
became acute. The Venetian state was determined to invest heavily in
strengthening this last bastion of its maritime empire abroad. At the most
literal level, this meant a drastic reinforcement of the fortification walls
surrounding the capital, known at the time as Candia or Kastro, today’s
Heraklion. One of the greatest military engineers of the age, Michele
Sanmicheli, was drafted in from Venice to create a system of bastions,
earthworks, and carefully cleared fields of fire to proof the town against the
heaviest artillery that might be brought against it. Venetian Crete would be
defended by the very latest technology that was available; there was to be
no risk of Candia going the way of Constantinople in the previous century.
The outlay for the Venetian treasury must have far exceeded any direct
revenues that could have been expected to flow in the other direction.
Modern historians see a transition at this time from a colonial relationship
to one between a capital city and a province.16
The investment didn’t stop at stones and mortar. The Venetians also set
about, belatedly, winning over hearts and minds. The results would be
spectacular—but of course, in Venetian Crete, just as in the Ottoman
Empire, there were no Greeks in the very highest positions of power. The
initial push came from above, from the rulers, even though it would be
Greeks, for the most part writing and working in their own language, who

would create the little-known miracle that today we call ‘Renaissance
Crete’.
Religious segregation was no longer enforced. The proselytizing Catholic
order, the Society of Jesus (also known as the Jesuits), was expelled from
the island shortly before 1600, once the authorities understood how far their
activities were alienating the native population. A growing middle class in
the thriving Cretan towns—Candia, Rethymno, and Chania—was gaining
an ever greater share of overseas trade, which until this time had been
jealously reserved for merchants from Venice. Education was largely in the
hands of private tutors, rather than a matter for the state. But there seems to
have been no lack of suitably qualified teachers in the Cretan towns. Legal
documents that survive in the Venetian archives testify to an impressive
level of literacy, for the time, among the island’s townspeople.17
In this new climate, Cretan painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries cultivated a subtle fusion of traditional Byzantine religious
imagery with new elements, such as perspective, learned from Renaissance
painters in Italy. Their work travelled far beyond the island to monasteries
and churches in the Ottoman Empire and sometimes even to Venice.
Domenikos Theotokopoulos, born in Candia in 1541, learned the art of
painting in his native island and was already earning eyewatering prices for
his work there before he left to seek his fortune in Italy. First in Venice, and
then in Rome, Theotokopoulos developed his own idiosyncratic version of
the high Renaissance style. But people found his name too much of a
mouthful, so they called him ‘il Greco’ (the Greek) instead. Adapted to the
hybrid Spanish-Italian form ‘El Greco’, this would become the name by
which one of the greatest of all the religious painters of the Renaissance
would become known to posterity, after he moved in 1577 to the city of
Toledo in Spain. From the contents of his library, we know that El Greco
had acquired a sound education in ancient Greek, as well as Latin and
Italian. And to the end of his life, he would sign his works, in Greek script,
with his given name, to which he would add ‘the Cretan’.18
But to appreciate the fullest extent of the cultural fusion between east and
west that was taking place in Venetian Crete around the turn of the
seventeenth century, one has to turn to the poetry and drama written in the
contemporary Cretan dialect of Greek. Plays had not been regularly

performed in Greek anywhere for more than a thousand years. Now, new
works were being written and staged in Candia, from at least the 1580s until
the very last years of Venetian rule, when the town was under siege and
Turkish cannonballs were falling inside Sanmicheli’s fortification walls.
Many of these works have been lost because no one ever thought to bring a
printing press from Venice. Most of them circulated only in manuscript.
Only a handful made it as far as the metropolis to be published there. But
from manuscripts that survive, we learn yet another curious aspect of that
fusion. Instead of writing in the traditional Greek script, authors who wrote
in the contemporary Cretan dialect used the roman alphabet, giving the
letters the same sound values as they have in Italian. Words on the page
look at first sight like Italian, but as soon as you hear them spoken you
recognise the distinctive sounds of Cretan Greek, as they can still be heard
in Crete today.
The dramatist Georgios Chortatsis was only a few years younger than El
Greco. His plays were probably written and first performed during the
1590s, at the very time when his younger contemporary, William
Shakespeare, was embarking on his career in London. In Chortatsis’s
tragedy Erophile, a king’s daughter falls in love with one of her father’s
courtiers and they are married in secret. The king, balked of his ambition to
marry her off to royalty and in this way to establish a blue-blood dynasty,
takes a terrible revenge. Pretending forgiveness, he invites Erophile to open
the wedding present he has prepared for her. It turns out to contain the
dismembered body of her beloved. By the end, almost everybody is dead—
even the king, who in a rather daring move on the part of the dramatist is
despatched, onstage, by the chorus of Erophile’s serving maids.
Cretan comedies, by Chortatsis and others, follow conventions that had
been revived by the Italian Renaissance and that go back, via Roman
comedy, to the New Comedy of fourth-century-BCE Athens. Thwarted
lovers overcome implausible obstacles, long-lost family members are
reunited, and stock characters raise predictable laughs.19 One of those is the
schoolmaster, who in several plays has a lewd eye for his young male pupils
and constantly shows off his proficiency in Italian and Latin. In Katzarapos
by Chortatsis, and Fortounatos, written by Markos Antonios Foskolos half
a century later in the 1650s, this character’s learned utterances are

constantly mistaken by other characters for hilariously inappropriate, or
even obscene, statements in Greek.
For readers today, these word games are not merely a source of recondite
amusement; they give us the best clues we could hope for to the background
that these dramatists must have shared with their audiences. In the imagined
world of Cretan comedy, just as in reality, Italian is the language of the
highest social class, Latin of the educated. But it has been pointed out that
not a single joke of this sort plays on ancient Greek.20 Cretan dramatists
seem to know of the ancient Greek world and its achievements only through
the medium of Italian and Latin—that is to say, filtered through the prism of
the Renaissance, which had already reinterpreted them in its own way.
Plenty of Cretans in Chortatsis’s day were capable of reading Aristotle or
Aeschylus in the original, and we know that works by these authors were in
circulation in Crete. But it seems that those who had been educated in the
ancient language moved in different circles from the writers who brought
the fresh air of the vernacular into an age-old tradition—exactly as
Shakespeare and his contemporaries, also with a limited classical education,
were doing at the same time in England.
The literary masterpiece of Venetian Crete, the romance, or novel in verse,
Erotokritos by Vitsentsos Kornaros was probably completed within a few
years either side of 1600. The author’s name reveals him as one of the very
numerous Cretan descendants of the famous Venetian aristocratic family of
Correr. Sometimes wrongly called an ‘epic’, Erotokritos is a story of
romantic love stretched out to some ten thousand lines and divided into the
equivalent of the five acts of a stage play. It is at least as good as The Old
Arcadia by Sir Philip Sidney, written at almost exactly the same time in
Elizabethan England, and which it rather resembles. But unlike Sidney’s
prose romance, Erotokritos has never ceased to be read. Not only that, but
from the seventeenth century to the twentieth, the poem would enjoy an
afterlife that its author could surely never have imagined—sung all over the
Cretan mountains by ‘rhymesters’ of little or no education, who have kept
favourite passages alive as part of the oral tradition of the island. Today the
name of the poem’s male protagonist, Erotokritos, is revered in Crete as
much as that of King Minos. There is probably still scarcely a Cretan alive

who cannot recite, or at least recognise, the lines in which the hero bids
farewell to his beloved Aretousa through the bars of her prison.21
The story is set ‘in times of old, when Hellenes ruled’, before the coming
of Christianity; the action takes place:
in Athens which was the nursemaid of learning,
the throne of power and fount of knowledge.
Whatever Kornaros actually knew about ancient Athens, he is content to
leave it at that. The characters worship the sun and moon rather than any
actual ancient gods. But it soon turns out that the imagined world of
Erotokritos is not so remote from the author’s own time and place after
all.22
In the second ‘act’, a tournament (still at that time a popular sport in
Crete, and of course imported from the medieval west) brings together
contestants from all over the contemporary Aegean. Among them are a
‘prince of Byzantium’ and a Cretan, who between them steal much of the
action until eventually the prize in the contest goes to the story’s hero, as it
must. Charidimos, the Cretan, is pitted against a ferocious Turk who, we are
told, ‘was like a wild beast… and had great enmity toward the isle of
Crete’. The rules of chivalry are cast aside as these two fight to the death.
All in the crowd hold their breath, fearing for the life of the Cretan, whose
‘virtue and wisdom and grace of speech’ make him everyone’s favourite.23
Supposedly taking place in ancient Athens, the mortal combat between the
Cretan and the Turk, and the bloody victory of the Cretan, seem to reflect in
microcosm the conflict between Venetian Crete and the Ottoman Empire.
The sympathy of the crowd for the knight Charidimos in turn implies
solidarity between the Greek speakers for whom the story was written and
the Venetian state in its struggle to survive.
For many Cretans, particularly those who lived in the towns or owned
property in the country, that solidarity was evidently real and deep. Writing
when it was all over, in exile in the Italian city of Padua, one of their
number recalled at length the world he had known for the first fifty years of
his life. Zuanne Papadopoli (Ioannis Papadopoulos in Greek) came of a
landowning family of possibly Byzantine origin, which had at some point

converted to Catholicism. He himself had served as an official in the
Venetian administration. He writes in Italian, for the benefit of his new
countrymen—who, he expects, will find much that he has to tell
‘extraordinary’, if not ‘pure fiction… even though everything described…
is perfectly true’.24
The Crete that Papadopoli remembers is a land of plenty. He fondly
recalls the great variety of fish and meat, available in all seasons. Even
turkeys were farmed in Crete, he tells us—evidently an early import from
the New World—‘as large and as fat as pigs’, while snails were so plentiful
that no one would sell them, and the poorest had available to them an
abundance of a delicacy that is still much appreciated by Cretans today.25
Malmsey wine, so called after the Malevizi winegrowing district close to
the capital, was in demand as far away as England. So many sweet things
were exported from Crete at this time that the name ‘Candia’, often used for
the whole island as well as for the town, is the origin of the American
English word ‘candy’.
Papadopoli’s nostalgia is evident and understandable; but he was well
aware of the cracks beneath the foundations of the society that he so
lovingly describes. At the top of the social pyramid, the blue-blooded
descendants of the original colonial families he remembers as lazy,
incompetent landlords who sat on their vast, accumulated wealth and made
poor use of the yield of their estates. Their hired bodyguards, known as
bravi, were notorious for the murders committed in the service of their
masters, more often than not with impunity. Papadopoli’s account of hot
summer evenings in the capital, when bands of musicians sang and played
and noble youths strutted around with their armed gangs, all too often
looking for a fight, sounds exactly like a scene out of Shakespeare’s Romeo
and Juliet.26
At the base of the pyramid, and far more serious, was the plight of the
rural peasants:
The death-warrant for peasants in the Realm was galley service, because
the villagers were obliged to be ready to serve as rowers, each time the
Provveditor Generale wished to equip galleys by order of the Senate.

For this purpose they would make a roll or census of all the villagers,
drawing by lot two or three per village.27
This was no more humane than the Ottoman levy, the devshirme. Life
expectancy of those taken for this service, again according to Papadopoli,
would be no more than two or three years. And unlike those taken to serve
the sultan, there was no chance of preferment, even for a lucky few. A
century earlier, in Crete, similar levies had been used to raise the manpower
needed to build the fortifications for the towns. One enlightened
Provveditore Generale had warned his masters in Venice, back in 1589, that
‘these unfortunates raise with their sweat and their blood those very walls
which will shut them out in time of need and they will be left to the disposal
of the enemy’. The same observer had also made the point that in Cyprus
the Ottoman invaders had only been helped by the disaffection of a
peasantry that had nothing left to lose.28
The warning would prove prophetic. But even though the Venetians were
aware of the problem, neither the Senate in Venice nor the authorities in
Candia would ever find a way to overcome it. The Venetians desperately
needed the manpower drawn from the peasants of Crete. Although they had
eventually conceded rights and privileges to the higher levels of Cretan
society, it seems never to have occurred to their legislators to do the same
for the peasants. Or perhaps they were simply afraid to put weapons into the
hands of people whose forefathers had so often in the past risen up against
them. As a result, the largest part of the population, outside the fortified
towns, was not only deprived of protection but also of any incentive to buy
into the state system. This was the fundamental reason why this most
hopeful of hopeful monsters, which had far outstripped every previous
attempt at fusion between Greek east and Latin west, was doomed, like all
the others, to extinction.
By this time, Greeks were on the move again—probably more than they
ever had been since ancient times. Beginning in the fifteenth century, many
had made new or temporary homes in Venice. In 1478, already some four
thousand Greeks had settled in the city. A century later, that number had
almost quadrupled. These were nearly all of them much humbler people

than the professors who had brought the benefits of a Byzantine education
to the west. Among trades recorded as being exercised by Greeks in Venice
in the early sixteenth century, we find tailors, swordsmiths, barbers,
carpenters, and builders, as well as mercenary soldiers, seamen, and
merchants. Women are represented in the records by seamstresses and wet
nurses, as well as, inevitably, ‘housewives’.29
Arriving in such numbers, these artisans and traders were able to form
their own community. Solitary teachers had been obliged to embrace
Catholicism in order to practise, but this much larger group successfully
petitioned to be allowed to build an Orthodox church for its members. After
many delays, San Giorgio dei Greci opened its doors to its first
congregations in 1573. Today, its belfry leaning slightly towards the canal
that flanks it, the Greek church remains a well-known landmark in the
Castello district of the city.
In an age when Europeans were setting out by ship to explore the entire
globe, for some Greeks Venice served as a springboard to adventures much
farther afield. Pedro de Candia, as his name suggests, came from Crete and
was one of the thirteen companions of Francisco Pizarro who conquered
Peru in the 1530s. Ioannis Phokas, born on the Venetian-ruled island of
Cephalonia in the same decade, also took service with a king of Spain,
Philip II this time. Phokas served on several voyages of exploration, sailing
east by way of the Cape of Good Hope, across the Indian Ocean to China
and then across the Pacific to the western seaboard of the Americas. Known
in Spanish as Juan de Fuca, he was apparently the first European to
navigate the channel that separates Vancouver Island, in Canada, from the
northwestern tip of Washington State in the USA and which bears his name
today.30
When the exceptionally well-travelled Nikandros Noukios, from Corfu,
arrived in England in 1545 as part of an embassy from the Holy Roman
Emperor Charles V to Henry VIII, he thought he was breaking new ground
—and it is true that Noukios was the first Greek to record an account of a
visit to the British Isles that we can read today. But not the least impressive
aspect of his narrative is his encounter with a squad of Greek mercenaries
serving in the English army, whose leader, one Thomas of Argos, he
befriended. In the high-flown style that Noukios borrows from Herodotus,

he attributes to his friend these rousing words as he prepared to lead his
troop, in the service of the English king, into battle against the French:
We are sons of Hellenes and do not fear a swarm of barbarians.… Let
everyone say that men from Greece, finding themselves in the remotest
parts of Europe, showed themselves valorous in combat.
This speech is most unlikely ever to have been made, and certainly not in
such terms as these. But Noukios shows a certain dogged determination in
trying to revive the two-thousand-year-old distinction between ‘Hellenes’
and ‘barbarians’—and to put it into the mouth of an army captain rousing
his compatriots to fight for one lot of ‘barbarians’ (the English) against
another (the French) in a distant land.31
These were evidently exceptional individuals—though it seems that
mercenaries like the ones encountered by Noukios could be found in armies
all over western Europe in his day. By far the greatest number of new
journeys made by Greeks, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
were trading voyages. The epicentre of this new burst of activity was not
Venice, nor even Candia, but Constantinople. By the early 1600s, the total
population of the Ottoman capital had risen to something between two and
three hundred thousand. Of those, it has been estimated that a remarkable
40 per cent were Greek Orthodox. Constantinople was once again ‘the
capital of the Greek world’.32
At the very time when enterprising Greeks living under Venetian rule
were winning the right to own their own ships and to buy and sell their own
cargoes, their compatriots in Constantinople had acquired a near monopoly
on seaborne trade in the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans had long ago
cancelled the privileges that the Byzantines had given away to their Italian
commercial rivals. Steadily, ever since, it was Greeks who had moved in, to
fill the vacuum left behind. New trading networks were being established
by highly mobile Greek families, whose branches would spread out so as to
straddle the great divide between east and west, between Islam and
Christendom. Merchant houses based in Constantinople would work with
family members strategically placed in Venice, Candia, or Corfu to control
the exchange of goods over great distances. On the Aegean coast of
Anatolia, the rise of Smyrna (today’s Izmir) to become one of the great

commercial centres of the eastern Mediterranean began spectacularly
during the first decades of the seventeenth century, with a huge influx of
Greeks, along with Armenians and Jews, who among them ran the
burgeoning European trade. The time would come when Orthodox Greek
speakers would outnumber the Muslim population of the city nicknamed in
Turkish ‘infidel Smyrna’.33
While the ‘Cretan Renaissance’ was enjoying its heyday under Venetian
rule, Greek trading networks were once again spreading out across the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Once more the Greek language could be
heard from end to end of the maritime trade routes that had first been
opened up some two thousand years before by the pioneer founders of
Greek city-states during the ‘age of experiment’. Greeks were learning to
find advantages to living between two opposing worlds. And in the process,
the foundations for the great Greek shipping dynasties of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries were already being laid.
The final act for Venetian Crete began almost by accident. In the summer
of 1644, an Ottoman ship carrying pilgrims on their way to Mecca was
captured in the Aegean by a flotilla sent out from Malta, the headquarters of
the Knights of Saint John. The Ottomans were determined to punish this act
of blatant piracy. But the last time they had sent a fleet against Malta,
almost a century before, it had ended badly. Malta, lying so far to the west,
would be of little use to them in any case. Crete, on the other hand, was
much closer and had long been coveted. Technically, the Venetian
authorities in Crete were implicated, since the prize and its captors had
stopped off briefly at Candia on their way home. No one in either Crete or
Venice was expecting it when the Ottoman fleet put ashore a huge fighting
force in western Crete at the end of June 1645. Chania capitulated after a
siege that lasted two months. Rethymno was next, the following year.34
Exactly as wiser counsels had predicted, there was little resistance to the
invaders on the part of the local peasantry. As a result, by 1648, the whole
island, with the exception of Candia and a handful of fortresses, was under
Ottoman control. The new rulers moved swiftly to install an Orthodox
archbishop and an Orthodox hierarchy. At a stroke, the restrictions that the
Venetians had maintained for four and a half centuries were swept away.

For the Orthodox peasants who had resented for so long the ‘popish mitre’,
the ‘Turkish turban’ was definitely to be preferred. There were some who
went even further: so great was their pent-up hatred of the Venetians that
many Cretan villagers embraced Islam and chose to fight alongside the
invaders who now laid siege to Candia, and against their former masters.
According to one contemporary western account, by 1657, sixty thousand
Cretans had converted—almost a quarter of the island’s total population
before the war, and far more than had ever been prepared to give up their
Orthodox traditions for the rival Catholic branch of their own religion.35
Everywhere outside the capital, the ‘Cretan Renaissance’ was already at
an end. But the fortifications of Candia, that had been reinforced by
Sanmicheli in the previous century, were proving their worth. For twentyone years, every assault failed. And since the Ottoman navy was never able
to impose an effective blockade, the defenders could be supplied by sea,
even though they were completely cut off from their own hinterland. By the
end, most of the Catholic powers of Europe had rallied to the defence of
this last outpost of western influence in the eastern Mediterranean. Spain
sent money and supplies; several French contingents arrived at different
times and were either killed or departed again. At one point the Venetians
even entertained hopes of help from Protestant England. Mercenary
‘soldiers of fortune’ from all nations, including English and Scots, found
their way to Candia to aid the cause.36
Native Cretans fought bravely alongside them. Overwhelmingly, these
were the townspeople, those who had most fully invested in the VenetoCretan way of life. The chronicler of the war, Marinos Tzane Bounialis,
writing up the story in verse in Cretan Greek shortly afterwards, went out of
his way to emphasise the loyalty of those native ‘Romans’ (Orthodox Greek
speakers) who made common cause with the ‘Franks’ (Catholics, whether
Venetian or from elsewhere). But even he could not gloss over the defection
of some highly placed individuals as the pressures of the siege took their
toll. And the besiegers evidently found it worth their while to invest large
sums in bribes to encourage more.37
The final act was not a battle but a negotiation. The Turks could not break
through the walls. The defenders had just been weakened by the departure
of the latest contingent that had recently arrived from France. They had had

enough. At the end of August 1669, two representatives from each side met
in secret to hammer out terms of surrender. In command of the defence was
the last Provveditore Generale, Francesco Morosini; the besiegers were led
by the formidable grand vizier, Fazil Ahmed Köprülü. Representing
Morosini were a Scotsman and a Greek from the local Cretan aristocracy;
representing the vizier were a Turk and another Greek, this time from
Chios, by the name of Panagiotis Nikousios.
Sharing the same language and interpreting between the Scotsman
(presumably in Italian) and the Turk, the two Greeks seem to have done
their utmost to advance the interests of their respective sides. Without that
bridge of language and the negotiating skills that had been honed by
generations of doing business right across the divided Mediterranean, there
could have been no peaceful end to the siege. What the Greek speakers
representing each party thought of those on the other is much harder to
gauge. Bounialis, for instance, has nothing but contempt for those on his
own side who defected to the enemy. But he writes with the greatest respect
of the Greek representative of the Ottomans at these negotiations
(‘Panagiotakis the Roman’, he calls him), even while he harbours not the
slightest doubt that this fellow Greek is the bitterest of enemies.38
And so, in the last days of September 1669, the Venetians sailed away in
their galleys. With them went the foreign fighters who had remained and
most of the population who had stayed in the town to the last. Many would
find new homes in the Ionian Islands, in Venice itself, or elsewhere in
Venetian territory in Italy, as Zuane Papadopoli did in Padua. The Greek
Orthodox population of Venice would grow yet again, by many thousands.
The boundaries between the Islamic east and the Christian west had shifted.
Greek speakers remained as deeply embedded as ever in each of those
opposing worlds and would soon find new ways to exploit their unique
facility for moving between them.

‘GREEK REVIVAL’
1669–1833

V

enetian Crete was no more. But the last of the great armed struggles

between the Ottoman Empire and the Christian states of Europe still had
another half century to run. Almost every Greek speaker who lived through
them must have been affected by these convulsions. Once again, we find
Greeks in arms serving in the ranks of opposing sides, whether forcibly
conscripted or as paid mercenaries. And once again the best Greek minds of
the age would be tested by the challenge of negotiating peace—on behalf of
masters who belonged to a different faith and language.
Fourteen years after the surrender of Candia, in 1683, emboldened by
their success in Crete, Ottoman land forces struck northwards and
westwards through the Balkans to lay siege to Vienna for the second time.
For two months, during the late summer of that year, it looked as though the
Habsburg capital would go the way of Candia. But once again,
reinforcements from other Catholic states arrived just in time, and on this
occasion their intervention was decisive. The retreat from Vienna and a
string of defeats in the Balkans during the years that followed mark the
turning point of Ottoman fortunes in mainland Europe.1
The Venetians were quick to take advantage. Although Crete proved too
distant and too strong to take back, Venetian forces, once again under the
command of Francesco Morosini, seized control of almost all the southern
mainland of Greece, including the whole of the Peloponnese, between 1685
and 1687. Athens was briefly taken at the end of the latter year—though not
before a cannonball, fired into the Parthenon from a Venetian battery, had

ignited gunpowder stored inside. The resulting explosion blew off the roof
and caused much of the two-thousand-year-old building to collapse.
Venice had never before possessed so much of the Greek mainland. But
the native Greek-speaking population had no enthusiasm for this enforced
change of masters—since the Catholic Venetians were far less tolerant of
their Orthodox faith and practices than the Ottomans had been. No one,
now, was talking of union between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.
The indifference of the local Greeks is probably the main reason why the
fortunes of war soon swung back the other way. When hostilities broke out
again in 1714, the Venetians were forced to abandon everything that they
had gained and, the year after, left the Greek mainland for good. Venice
would never recover from the demands of its last, short-lived campaign in
Greece.
The Ottoman Empire, too, was changing. The centuries of conquest were
over. And as the empire changed, its rulers found themselves in need of
skills that had not been much prized before this time. This was where the
most highly educated among the Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians in
Constantinople came into their own. Panagiotis Nikousios, who had served
as one of the two negotiators for the Ottoman side in the closing stages of
the siege of Candia, had studied medicine at the University of Padua. It was
as a physician that Nikousios had first gained the confidence of the grand
vizier whom he served. Like many sons of wealthy Greek families in the
capital, Nikousios was also proficient in half a dozen languages, ancient and
modern, as well as Ottoman Turkish. His reward was to be promoted to the
newly created office of Grand Dragoman, or interpreter. From then on, the
grand dragoman would become the senior diplomat in the Ottoman service.
For more than a century, this office would be held exclusively by wealthy
and highly educated Greek-speaking Orthodox subjects of the empire.2
It fell to Alexandros Mavrokordatos, the second grand dragoman, to
represent the sultan in a still more demanding diplomatic task. In 1688, the
Ottomans were losing badly to the Austrians and Hungarians. Negotiations
failed on that occasion. But eleven years later, Mavrokordatos deserves a
large share of the credit for the first peace treaty ever to be signed between
the Ottoman Empire and an alliance of European powers at Karlowitz
(today’s Sremci Karlovski, in Serbia) in 1699. With consummate skill,

Mavrokordatos gained the confidence of the representatives of Russia,
Austria, and France, as well as of his own side. It has been speculated that
the grand dragoman may have been acting as a quadruple agent; on the
other hand, just as Nikousios had done in Crete, Mavrokordatos did at least
secure the best possible terms for his Ottoman masters.3 The treaty of
Karlowitz would soon be broken. But a precedent had been set. And after
the Ottomans had defeated the Venetians in the Peloponnese, and in turn
had been beaten by the Austrians in the Balkans, a second treaty was signed
at Passarowitz, today’s Požarevac, not far from Belgrade, on 21 July 1718.
And this time the peace would hold (more or less) for half a century.4
Now the stage was set for other highly placed Greeks to follow where
Nikousios and Mavrokordatos had led. Learning, usually gained at a
university in the west, was the passport to success. Soon, not only the role
of grand dragoman but also other trusted positions in the Ottoman
administration would become effectively Greek prerogatives. In this way a
semiofficial Greek-speaking aristocracy arose within the Ottoman elite.
These people would become known as ‘Phanariots’, from the name of the
district in the capital where the Ecumenical Patriarchate was (and is still)
housed—Phanari in Greek, today the Fener quarter of Istanbul. Orthodox
Christians were of course still excluded from the very highest levels of
government (Greeks could only reach those by converting to Islam); but as
the eighteenth century progressed, the tight-knit Greek-speaking
community of Phanariots would become an increasingly indispensable part
of the Ottoman system.5
Individuals rose to prominence through a combination of successful
commercial enterprise, state privilege, and a foreign education. It was a
self-perpetuating cycle. The profits of trade could be invested in the
education of the next generation. Education and wealth together would open
the door to a privileged position in the service of the state, which had to be
bought. Offices of state would bring still greater profits to the holder, and
these could be ploughed back to renew the cycle. For this Greek-speaking
aristocracy, mobility was the key to success. Theirs was an often precarious
existence: tenure of the most coveted positions tended to be short, and many
an illustrious career would end in impoverishment or execution. But it was

not a closed system. As some fell from grace, there was always scope for
new entrants to climb up from below.6
The centre of gravity for the Phanariots was naturally the capital. But
from early in the eighteenth century, many of these families found
themselves exported northwards, into the buffer zones that separated the
Ottoman from the Habsburg and Russian Empires. The provinces of
Wallachia and Moldavia, which together make up two-thirds of today’s
Romania and lie immediately to the north of the Danube, had remained
technically Ottoman territory after the treaty of Passarowitz. But because
their populations were almost entirely Orthodox Christian, successive
sultans delegated the task of ruling them, not to the native population, the
ancestors of today’s Romanians, but to members of the Greek Phanariot
aristocracy. In this way, throughout the eighteenth century, not just the
ruling families but also a whole supporting network of Greek-speaking
bureaucrats came to be transferred from Constantinople to Bucharest and
Jassy (modern Iaşi) and to put down roots there.
At the same time, Greek speakers in humbler walks of life were becoming
more mobile than ever. Opportunities for trade brought more and more of
them to move beyond the bounds of the Ottoman Empire. In London, the
first coffee houses were opened in the 1660s by ‘Nicholas the Grecian’ and
one Georgios Konstantinos, whose shop was known as ‘The Grecian’. Soon
the nucleus of a community had grown up in the Soho district of the capital,
where the name ‘Greek Street’ remains to this day. The first Orthodox
church in London opened its doors in Greek Street in 1681. During the next
century, others would follow in most of the great commercial centres of
Europe—Vienna, Trieste, Livorno, Marseille, Paris, Amsterdam. By the end
of that century, communities would be established as far away as Calcutta
and Dacca in Bengal in one direction, and Argentina in another.7
The closing decades of the century saw huge new opportunities open that
would set in motion an even larger migration of Greek-speaking Orthodox
Christians. The century of relative peace between the sultans and their
western neighbours also saw the start of a series of wars against Russia.
One of these conflicts, fought between 1768 and 1774, for the first time
brought a Russian fleet from Saint Petersburg, by way of the Atlantic, into
the eastern Mediterranean. Encouraged by Russian propaganda, the Greek-

speaking regions of Crete and the Peloponnese rose up in revolt in 1770.
These were the first really serious rebellions against Ottoman rule—more
than three hundred years after the conquest of Constantinople—and they
were brutally suppressed. No Russian troops landed to make common cause
with their Orthodox co-religionists. But Russia still came off best and
succeeded in annexing from the Ottoman Empire the whole northern shore
of the Black Sea and its hinterland.
It then became the policy of Catherine the Great, the Russian empress, to
populate ‘New Russia’, as these territories became known, with Christians
from the Ottoman Empire. Many thousands of Greeks had been
compromised with the Ottoman authorities during the recent revolts,
whether they had actively participated or not. The offer of grants of land to
farm in a new, Orthodox homeland proved irresistible. For the first time
since the ‘Empire of Trebizond’ had capitulated to Mehmed II in 1461,
Greek speakers had the possibility to live under a Christian Orthodox
administration, as subjects of the Russian tsars. It has been estimated that a
quarter of a million answered the call.8 Urban communities grew up in
Taganrog on the Sea of Azov and in the newly founded cities of Odessa,
Mariupol, and Sebastopol (the last two with lightly Russianised Greek
names). The rich grain-growing country of New Russia, after centuries of
neglect, once again became a source of prosperity, just as it had been in
ancient times.
The immigrant Greeks started out as farmers, but most soon gave up the
land and went into trade. In this they were immeasurably assisted by the
family networks that many maintained, whether back in the Ottoman
Empire, farther west in Europe, or both. These networks would go on to
dominate the international trade in Russian grain until the late nineteenth
century. By the end of the eighteenth, Greek-owned merchant ships made
up the largest fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, with a thousand ‘deepseagoing’ vessels trading, mainly under the Ottoman flag.9 The map of
Greek mercantile communities flourishing by that time—from the Sea of
Azov in the east to Marseille in the west—by a quirk of history seems
almost to re-create the pattern of the seventh century BCE. The historical
circumstances, of course, were completely different, as the Greek language
itself tacitly acknowledges. The term used for these modern communities

established abroad is not apoikia (‘home from home’ in the ancient world)
but paroikia, which means roughly ‘a home in a foreign land’.
This time, it was not just by sea that trading activity was becoming
concentrated in Greek hands. The great rivers of southeastern Europe and
Russia—the Danube, the Don, and the Dnieper—were opening up to the
movement of ever more goods by water. Greeks, originally from Crete and
the Aegean islands, traded wine as far north as Poland. At the same time, if
probably on a smaller scale, overland trade was growing, too, both inside
the Ottoman Empire and beyond its borders. From urban centres in the
north of today’s Greece, caravans of camels set out to cross the mountain
ranges of the Balkans to connect with the great artery of the Danube.10
By the second half of the eighteenth century, Greek elites of varying size,
wealth, and political influence were established in Constantinople, in the
Danubian principalities (as Wallachia and Moldavia were collectively
known), in the Ionian Islands, and in southern Russia, as well as in many
cities of western and central Europe. Of all these places, only the Ionian
Islands, which at the time still belonged to a now-fading Venetian Republic,
would eventually become part of the Greek state as we know it today; most
lie far beyond its borders.
Indeed, the Greek-speaking world of the eighteenth century was nothing
like a modern state. Even the relatively settled majority—the peasant
farmers, herders, and fishermen who rarely make it into the history books—
lived spread out across a wide geographical area. Beginning in the west
with the Ionian Islands, this took in the Greek peninsula, an arc of the
Balkan mainland bordering the northern Aegean, all of the islands as far
south as Crete, parts of the western Anatolian seaboard, and detached
enclaves in Cyprus, Cappadocia in central Anatolia, and Pontos in the
northeast. In many of these areas, and particularly outside the towns, Greek
speakers undoubtedly made up the largest part of the population. But there
was no single heartland where everybody spoke Greek as a first language.
Wherever you went in all those regions, you would hear other languages
being spoken in the street, see other languages and scripts in use in public
signs. Most people must have been able to function with a smattering of one
or more languages other than their own.

The wider Greek world that was taking shape during the eighteenth
century has often been described as a diaspora—a Greek word meaning
‘dispersal’, which had first been applied to the Jews. But the idea of a
dispersal presupposes the existence of a corresponding centre. In the case of
the Greeks in the eighteenth century, there was no centre.11 This was a
world that rather more resembled the Hellenistic one created by the
conquests of Alexander—with the difference that this time Greek speakers
were not the rulers but the ruled.
There was another similarity, too, though once again the historical reasons
for it were quite different. Education in the Ottoman Empire was left to the
different religious communities to organise for themselves. Schools had
been established by the Orthodox Church in Constantinople since shortly
after the conquest. The eighteenth century saw a massive expansion of
education aimed at the Christian population, directed by the church, in
urban centres wherever there was a community large enough to make a
school viable. From the beginning, the language of instruction was Greek.
Essentially, this was a more modest continuation of the old Byzantine
programme of education. The Greek language had never lost its prestige; it
remained the bureaucratic language of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, and
therefore of the higher clergy throughout the empire. As schools began to
proliferate in the eighteenth century, those who were destined to become
merchants or doctors, bureaucrats, priests, or sometimes even high officials
in the Ottoman system would learn to read and write in Greek—even if the
family spoke a Slavonic language, or Albanian, or Wallachian (Romanian)
at home.12 Becoming Greek was once again in fashion in the European
provinces of the Ottoman Empire, and once again it brought practical as
well as intellectual benefits.
In many parts of Christian Europe, too, Greek ways of thinking and doing
were in fashion as never before. The eighteenth century was the era of
Neoclassicism in the arts and of the Enlightenment in philosophy and the
sciences. The century of the Enlightenment has also been called the Age of
Reason because the new ideas that were being pioneered and promoted,
particularly in France, were systematically based on rational principles.
These, too, went back to the earliest years of Greek philosophy.

Although the actual business of government in most of the larger
European states was conducted along autocratic lines, educated individuals
began to exchange ideas about what might be the best, and most rational,
form of government for human societies—just as once upon a time had
happened in the ancient Greek city-states. Inevitably, this brought many of
the new thinkers, either implicitly or explicitly, into conflict with the
Catholic church—an institution that of course had no equivalent in the
ancient world. Out of this ferment of ideas came the ‘social contract’ of
Geneva-born Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who first began to articulate the
concept of the nation as a voluntary association of individuals and groups
who surrender some of their liberties in return for corresponding rights.
These ideas would transform the political landscape of large parts of the
world during the next three centuries.13
The Encyclopaedia, or Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and
Crafts, published in Paris in multiple volumes between 1751 and 1772,
became an extended manifesto for the Age of Reason. Encyclopaedia, as
the editor in chief Denis Diderot explained, was a modern word based on
ancient Greek, intended to mean ‘joined up knowledge’. The avowed aim of
the project, he went on, was nothing less than to ‘change the common way
of thinking’. Elsewhere in the Encyclopaedia, civilisation, another new and
still rare word in French, was presented as the gift of ‘the illustrious dead,
the sages of antiquity… sacred shades, the objects of veneration’. First
among those, in a long list of philosophers and lawgivers drawn from the
ancient Greek world, comes Socrates, who ‘braved the fury of tyrants,
without fearing for his life, without fearing death, knowing no other masters
than the sacred laws of enlightened reason’.14
Those words were published in 1765. A year earlier, the German art
historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann had brought out his History of the
Art of Antiquity. This extraordinarily influential work set out the bold new
claim that the greatest heights of European art and the human spirit had
been reached not by the ancient Romans but by the Greeks before them.
According to Winckelmann, who had never been there, this was because
Greece was blessed with a perfect climate. As a consequence, he
maintained, not only the arts but political liberty, too, had been perfected in
the Greek city-states. ‘The only way for us [moderns] to become great’, he

famously asserted, ‘is to imitate the Ancients.’ As the emerging modern
civilisation of Europe began to define itself and to gain confidence, the
intellectual, artistic, and political inheritance from the ancient Greek citystates, along with republican Rome, became deeply embedded in the entire
project. From now on, the building of a modern, ‘Western’ civilisation
would be founded on the rediscovery—as well as, often, the distortion or
reinvention—of the legacy of the Greeks of antiquity.15
During the decades that spanned the turn of the nineteenth century, the
craze for things Greek was beginning to make its mark on the appearance of
cities, not only in Europe but also wherever Europeans were establishing
their presence as colonists on other continents. In town planning, the grid
plan that went back to Hippodamus of Miletus in the fifth century BCE and
that had been adopted for all the new Greek cities founded in the wake of
Alexander’s conquests, was revived in places as far apart as the ‘New
Town’ of Edinburgh, begun in the latter part of the eighteenth century, and a
few decades later, in several cities in North America and in Melbourne and
Adelaide in Australia. In the early years of the nineteenth, the Scottish
capital even began to pride itself on being known as the ‘New Athens’ or
the ‘Athens of the North’.16
At the same time, the neoclassical trend reached a late peak in a ‘Greek
Revival’ that would soon leave its mark on the monumental architecture of
several continents. When a new parish church was built for what was then a
suburb of expanding London between 1819 and 1822, its design faithfully
reproduced features of the temple on the Acropolis of Athens known as the
Erechtheion—including a ‘Caryatid’ porch, in which the columns take the
form of draped female figures. Now grime-stained from decades of London
pollution, the Caryatids of Saint Pancras New Church stare severely over
the heads of pedestrians and traffic too busy to take much notice of them as
they pass by on Euston Road. Winckelmann’s injunction to ‘imitate the
ancients’ had fallen on fertile ground.
Wealthy connoisseurs of art from all over western Europe competed with
one another to bring back prized examples of ancient Greek sculpture to
their own countries. However shocking to modern sensibilities, this was a
practice as much taken for granted at the time as the establishment of
European colonies abroad. In the case of antiquities, it was driven by a new

and emerging sense of the cultural value of the objects acquired. The most
notorious of these collectors, Thomas Bruce, Seventh Earl of Elgin,
removed about half of the sculpted blocks that make up the frieze of the
Parthenon between 1801 and 1803. At first, Elgin had intended to use them
as a prestige adornment for his country seat in Scotland. It was only
unforeseen circumstances that led to the sculptures being put on public
exhibition in London and, eventually, in 1816, being acquired by the British
Museum.
Elgin’s actions were highly controversial at the time and have continued
to arouse competing passions ever since. But it was the arrival of the ‘Elgin
Marbles’ in London and the artistic judgements of the connoisseurs of the
day that finally set the seal on Winckelmann’s bold claim. For the first time,
the most intricate artwork that had once formed part of the rebuilding of the
Acropolis of Athens in the 430s BCE could be seen in its original form in a
Western city. And enough people were convinced that, yes, this was indeed
superior to the best productions of ancient Rome, that the opinion has never
seriously been challenged since. The marbles had passed to a dull climate in
a distant land, but the prestige of their homeland and the people who had
produced them had never been higher since at least the time of the Roman
emperor Hadrian.17
Travellers, in increasing numbers, returned to northern Europe from
seeking out the traces of Greek civilisation in the Ottoman Empire and
published accounts of what they had seen and experienced. The young
George Gordon, Lord Byron, suddenly became the most famous of these
when he published his travelogue in verse, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, in
1812. Byron speculated whether it could be possible for an ancient
civilisation to come back from the dead, reincarnated by its modern heirs.
Less poetically, other travellers were asking themselves and their readers
the same question.18 And thanks to the astonishing success of his youthful
work (Byron was only twenty-four when his poem was published), the
speculative possibility of a literal Greek revival reached into households not
only throughout Great Britain but also, in translation, in every corner of the
European continent. By 1821, a vaguely undefined ‘Greece’ was at the
forefront of public consciousness all over Europe, as well as in the young
United States of America.

Contemporary Greeks were well aware of these developments, whether
they lived in the Ottoman Empire or in communities scattered across
Europe. With the rapid spread of Greek schools and the movement of goods
by Greek entrepreneurs, ideas travelled far and fast. As literacy increased,
there was ever more demand for printed books. There were no printing
presses in Constantinople (except for brief, short-lived experiments) before
the nineteenth century, and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire only in
Wallachia and Moldavia, where they were sponsored by the Phanariot rulers
and the Orthodox Church. But Greek publishing houses flourished in many
European cities. Chief among these was Venice, where printing in Greek
had begun at the turn of the fifteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth,
Greek presses had been established in Vienna, Leipzig, Budapest, Trieste,
Moscow, and Saint Petersburg. Among them, these presses produced some
120,000 volumes during the century before 1821, most of them translations
from Western languages. Books were not prevented from circulating in
Ottoman territory; many, if not most, of the readers of these ones would
have been Ottoman subjects. In this way, the new secular ideas of the
European Enlightenment found their way to the hearts and minds of Greek
speakers, wherever they were to be found. And in response, a ‘Greek
Enlightenment’ grew up during the second half of the century.19
Educated Greeks were now reading the same books as their Western
counterparts. If Socrates and a dozen other ‘heroes’ of the intellect and of
battles such as Thermopylae and Salamis could inspire the veneration of the
editors of the Encyclopaedia, they had never been forgotten, either, by those
who continued to speak and write in a form of their own Greek language.
Knowledge of the ancient ‘classics’ had, after all, never been lost in the
Greek-speaking east. If the nations of Europe were starting to define their
own identity in terms that went back to the ancient city-states, was it not
time for enlightened Greeks to claim a portion of that inheritance for
themselves?20
This was not as simple a proposition as it might sound. Greek speakers
still overwhelmingly thought of themselves as ‘Romans’: in the language of
the time, Romioi, pronounced Romyí. To be a Romios, or (in the feminine)
Romia, meant above all to be an Orthodox Christian. In the Ottoman
Empire, the spread of secular education had been very largely sponsored by

the Orthodox Church. This meant that in the Orthodox east there was none
of the tension between established religion and the new ideas of the
Enlightenment that was so characteristic of the movement in the West—at
least until the very end of the eighteenth century. On the other hand, when
foreigners wrote about ‘Greece’ and ‘Greeks’ in their own languages, they
did so in a purely secular sense. And to confuse matters further, they
applied these names equally to both ancient and modern times. This was
impossible in Greek because the ancients were still known by the ancient
name of ‘Hellenes’. But ever since the time of Julian the Apostate in the
fourth century CE, this name had signified not just an ancient but a pagan
people. Modern Romans and ancient Hellenes may have been united by
their language, but bonds of religion went just as deep, and in those terms,
the pagan Hellenes were almost as alien as the Muslim Turks or the western
Catholics or Protestants.
The idea of a bloodline had counted for little during most of the
intervening centuries (Plethon, in the fifteenth century, had been the
exception). But now that those long-dead Hellenes were being lionised in
ever more exalted terms in the foreign books that Greeks were reading and
translating into their own language, it was time for this to change. The
solution that they came up with was to begin to think of themselves as the
sons, or the children, of the Hellenes of old. It helped that the phrase that
most naturally expressed this idea in the semiformal written Greek of the
time was identical to the war cry of the Greeks at the battle of Salamis, as
reported in Aeschylus’s drama The Persians: ‘Sons of Hellenes, onward.’ It
was becoming a matter of pride that the Hellenes of old had been the
ancestors; today’s Romans were their descendants.21
And because so many of those books written in other languages described
the ancient Greeks as a nation, could not the same be said of the moderns,
too? In the 1780s, the essayist and educational reformer Dimitrios Katartzis,
writing in Greek at the Phanariot court in Bucharest, could urge: ‘We can
become once again a nation, civilised and envied, to the extent that we are
able to approach the education of our ancestors.’ A few years later, a book
called Modern Geography, published in Greek in Vienna in 1791, gives the
ancient name of ‘Hellas’ to the southern Balkan peninsula and the islands of

the Aegean, while the people who live there are described as ‘modern
Hellenes’ and the descendants of an ancient ‘nation’.22
This was the beginning of a process that within three decades, between
1790 and 1820, would transform the way that many, if not yet most, Greek
speakers thought about themselves. From ‘sons of Hellenes’ or ‘modern
Hellenes’ it was a small step for contemporary Greeks to become simply
‘Hellenes’. At the same time, Orthodox Greek Christians began giving their
children ancient names alongside their baptismal ones. Names like
Themistocles, Pericles, Odysseus for boys and Penelope, Calliope, or
Aspasia for girls begin to appear in the record. New family names were
coined in the ancient way, by adding the suffix -ides or -ades to a personal
name, just as in the Odyssey, Odysseus the son of Laertes had been known
as Laertiades.
This was the surest sign that ordinary people, and not just intellectuals,
were beginning to think of the ancients as part of the same family as
themselves. The ‘hellenizing of the Romioi’, as it has been called, was the
biggest reinvention by Greek speakers since the much more gradual one
that had taken place under Roman rule some fifteen hundred years earlier. It
was fuelled by ideas that came from western Europe. And it went hand in
hand with another series of changes that were literally revolutionary.23
In July 1776, on the far side of the Atlantic, the American Declaration of
Independence set out the ‘self-evident truths’ that ‘all men are created
equal’ and enjoy an ‘inalienable’ right to ‘Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
Happiness’. Seven years later, the United States of America won
recognition as an independent republic after defeating the colonial power,
Great Britain. Then in 1789, again in July, the storming of the Bastille
fortress in Paris set in train the events we now know as the French
Revolution. Under the slogan Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité, revolutionaries
went on to overturn the centuries-old autocratic French monarchy, abolish
the role and privileges of the Catholic church, and turn France into a
‘republic’ made up of ‘citizens’. Some of the political organisation of the
French revolutionary republic, while it lasted, and much of the rhetoric
associated with it, were deliberately based on names and rituals revived
from republican Rome. If the revolutionary French could be heirs to one

ancient republic, perhaps similarly minded Greeks could revive the glories
of another—in their case, democratic Athens? In some quarters, particularly
among the expatriate communities of merchants abroad, and in the
intellectual circles of the Danubian principalities, enthusiasm was spreading
fast enough to alarm the Ottoman authorities and the highest echelons of the
Orthodox Church.24
In the Ionian Islands, it reached fever pitch in the summer of 1797. At the
end of June, a French expeditionary force landed to take possession.
Napoleon Bonaparte, at the time ‘first consul’ of the French Republic, had
recently forced the submission of Venice and despatched a fleet of French
warships to take over the foreign dominions that had belonged to the now
defunct ‘Most Serene Republic’. For two years after that, the Greek
Orthodox population of the Ionian Islands experienced what it was like to
be called ‘citizens’ and to be given rights, at least notionally. Elsewhere,
idealistic intellectuals, educated in the Enlightenment tradition—Rigas of
Velestino in Vienna, Adamantios Korais (also known as Coray) in Paris—
set about imagining in philosophical terms what a newly liberated Greece
might look like. Theirs were among a chorus of voices, many of them
anonymous, urging their fellow Greeks, in patriotic poems and pamphlets,
to rise up against their Ottoman masters and break free. In parts of the
Ottoman Empire, as well as in European cities, Greek revolutionary
anthems began to be composed and sung to the tune of the French ‘La
Marseillaise’.25
Not all Greeks were so enthusiastic. In 1798, the Ecumenical Patriarchate
of the Orthodox Church issued a stern encyclical that condemned ‘the
much-vaunted political programme of liberty’. God himself had ‘raised up
out of nothing the mighty empire of the Ottomans’ so as to rule over the
Orthodox faithful for their own ultimate good and to guarantee the
‘salvation of the chosen peoples’.26 While some Greeks looked eagerly to
the west and saw themselves as ‘new Hellenes’ and potential citizens of a
modern state on the French revolutionary model, the majority of Orthodox
Romans, from the patriarch of Constantinople down to the humblest
goatherd in the mountains or fisherman in the islands, had far more to lose
than to gain from revolutionary change.

But, whatever might have been the preference of the majority, among
Greeks as elsewhere in Europe, something that had been born during the
French Revolution had come to stay. This spirit survived almost twenty
years of the Napoleonic Wars, during which the French Republic became
the French Empire, and the first consul Napoleon became emperor. No part
of Europe was left untouched by these wars. After Napoleon was defeated,
for the first time in 1814 and then decisively at the Battle of Waterloo in
June 1815, the representatives of the European powers gathered in Vienna
to determine the future shape of the continent. The French Revolution and
its aftermath were at an end. Nothing like this must ever happen again.
So was born the ‘Concert of Europe’, an alliance of predominantly
autocratic states that determined to establish a new international order, from
the Atlantic to the Urals. But the ideas that had fanned out across the
continent were not to be so easily suppressed; across the Atlantic they had
already taken hold. Between 1811 and 1825, the Spanish and Portuguese
colonial possessions in South America followed the example of their
counterparts farther north and won their independence through wars of
liberation. Even within Europe, undercurrents were swirling just beneath
the surface. By 1820, secret societies had sprung up in many countries;
clandestine activity was rife. In the summer of that year, first in Spain and
then in Naples, capital of the ‘Kingdom of the Two Sicilies’, bloodless
revolutions compelled monarchs to grant parliamentary constitutions to
their subjects. A full-scale uprising in northern Italy, much of it at the time
ruled by Austria, was planned for early in 1821. In France, the elderly
Marquis de Lafayette, a veteran of both the American and the French
Revolutions, noted at the time: ‘The friends of liberty were never in such
perfect sympathy as in this moment of European crisis.’27
Every one of these revolutionary projects would prove abortive. But
Greek speakers had been forming societies, too. Most of these were
ostensibly cultural rather than political. Their members made good use of
the Greek printing presses that existed in several cities of Europe to
exchange and disseminate views which could broadly be described as
liberal. But one of these societies operated underground, and its aims were
avowedly violent: the Friendly Society, also known in English by its Greek
name, Philiki Etairia, was a secret society dedicated to a war of liberation.

It was said to have been founded by Greek merchants in the (then) Russian
city of Odessa in 1814, though this often repeated story has been
questioned. The Friendly Society may actually have begun life in the
Ottoman capital, and not until three years later.
Like all these clandestine societies, this one derived its rituals from
Freemasonry. From the records of its activities, it seems that the members
of the Friendly Society relished the secrecy and mystification of their
ceremonies almost as much as the extreme means by which they prepared
to pursue their goal. During the last months of 1820, an ambitious scheme
was hatched: to strike at the heart of Ottoman power by setting fire to the
fleet in the Golden Horn and simultaneously starting fires in the streets of
Constantinople. In the ensuing general panic, the Orthodox population was
to rise up and take over control of the capital.28
Events would turn out very differently. But by the beginning of the 1820s,
revolutionary fervour was running high in at least some parts of the Greekspeaking world and through some sections of the population—both inside
and outside the Ottoman Empire. Few people alive anywhere at the
beginning of the 1820s, probably, would have bet on a Greek revolution
being any more successful than so many others that had failed, still less on
what the outcome might be if by any chance it did succeed. There is little
sign that the secretive leadership of the Friendly Society had much of an
idea. But a revolution carried out by men and women who now thought of
themselves as Hellenes, in the name of an ancient nation in which so many
progressive Europeans, and indeed Americans, believed that they, too, had a
stake—that would turn out to be another proposition entirely.
It began on 6 March 1821 (or 22 February according to the calendar in use
in southeastern Europe at the time). A senior officer in the Russian imperial
service slipped across the River Pruth, with a handful of retainers, from
Kishinev (today’s Chișinău, capital of Moldova) in what was then Russian
territory into Ottoman-controlled Moldavia. Like many high-ranking
Russians in those days, his native language was Greek. His name was
Alexandros Ypsilantis, and he had recently become leader of the Friendly
Society. Two days later, in Jassy, the Moldavian capital, Ypsilantis issued a
proclamation headed ‘Fight for Faith and Fatherland’:

The hour has come, o Men of Hellas!… The enlightened peoples of
Europe… full of gratitude for the benefits bequeathed by our Ancestors
to themselves, eagerly await the liberty of the Hellenes.
A month after that, in Kalamata, near the southern tip of the Peloponnese,
a ‘manifesto addressed to Europe by Petros Mavromikhalis, Commanderin-Chief of the Spartan Troops, and the Messenian Senate’, announced that
the ‘unhappy Greeks of Peloponnesus’ had taken up arms against the
‘insupportable yoke of Ottoman tyranny’ and went on:
We invoke therefore the aid of all the civilized nations of Europe, that
we may the more promptly attain to the goal of a just and sacred
enterprise, reconquer our rights, and regenerate our unfortunate people.
Greece, our mother, was the lamp that illuminated you; on this ground
she reckons on your active philanthropy.29
For the first time in centuries, Greeks were ready to seize their political
destiny and take their future into their own hands. During March and April
1821, all of the Danubian principalities, most of what is now mainland
Greece, from Thessalonica in the north to the southern Peloponnese, and
many towns and islands across the Aegean rose up in response to this call.
Nothing on such a scale had ever happened before. The Ottoman state had
been facing internal challenges to its authority for a number of years, not
least from Muslim warlords in the Balkans, who had tried to break away on
their own account. But these had been essentially local upheavals; none
would have any lasting effect on the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The
Greek Revolution, as those proclamations show, was different—because it
was never intended to be a matter for Greeks alone.
Even so, during the first months, fearsome Ottoman reprisals came close
to stamping it out. In Moldavia and Wallachia, despite initial successes, the
thousands of Greek and other Balkan volunteers who had rallied to
Ypsilantis’s call were routed by an Ottoman army in June. Ypsilantis
himself sought refuge in Austrian territory, where he was interned for the
rest of his short life. Many of his supporters fought to the death or were
captured and executed. Farther south, in Macedonia, in Thessaly, and on the
seaboard of Anatolia, the revolt was ruthlessly suppressed. Despite the

ambitious plans of the Friendly Society, there was no outbreak in the
capital. But this did not save the Phanariot aristocracy from near
annihilation.
Within a few weeks in April and May, just about every Phanariot who had
not managed to escape from Constantinople in time was rounded up and
publicly beheaded. Gregory V, the seventy-five-year-old patriarch of the
Orthodox Church, was seized at the end of the liturgy on Easter Sunday, 22
April, and hanged from the gate of his own precinct. It made no difference
that Gregory had been one of those who had condemned the very idea of
liberty or revolution more than two decades before and had recently
excommunicated every Orthodox Christian who had dared to rebel against
the legitimate basileus, the sultan. Similarly, in Cyprus, where there had
been no uprising, the archbishop and leading members of the clergy were
put to death anyway, apparently just to set an example.
But in one part of the Greek-speaking world, the revolution did take hold.
This was the Peloponnese. The well-known story that the standard of revolt
was raised by the bishop of Old Patras at the monastery of Agia Lavra,
above the town of Kalavryta, on the day of the Christian festival of the
Annunciation, 25 March, is almost certainly apocryphal. But once violence
had broken out all over the peninsula in early April (or late March,
according to the calendar in use there at the time), there was no going back.
Local leaders, backed by former brigands and irregular bands of their armed
followers, seized the initiative and swept across the country.
Those Muslims who survived the onslaught took refuge with the Ottoman
garrisons that remained in the larger towns and in a series of strongholds
that had been built in the time of the crusaders or the Venetians. A decisive
moment came in October, when the chief town of the Peloponnese,
Tripolitsa (today’s Tripoli), was starved into submission and most of its
inhabitants massacred, despite being promised safe conduct by the
victorious Greeks. From the Peloponnese, the action spread to some of the
nearby islands, notably Hydra and Spetses just off the northeast coast and
Psara on the other side of the Aegean. Among them, these small islands
boasted the lion’s share of Greek-owned shipping in the eastern
Mediterranean. Armed merchantmen began to achieve successes against the
Ottoman navy. Other, larger islands joined in, including Samos and Crete,
though many did not.

At the end of the year, a first ‘national assembly’ brought together
representatives from all the areas that had been liberated to draw up a
constitution. The site chosen, in the northeastern Peloponnese, lay close to
the remains of the ancient theatre and sanctuary of the healing god
Asclepius at Epidaurus. The first provisional constitution that emerged has
ever since been known as the Epidaurus Constitution. This document drew
heavily on the short-lived constitutions of revolutionary France. From the
Constitution of the United States it derived the strict separation of powers
between the legislature and the executive. It also established for all time
that the newly liberated realm was to be known by the ancient name of
‘Hellas’, and its citizens as ‘Hellenes’. So effective has that collective act of
reinvention been that it requires an effort of imagination, today, to realise
what a radical innovation it was at the time. Many Greeks would continue
to think of themselves as Romans (Romioi), in everyday contexts and
informally among themselves, for at least a century and a half after that. But
the official designations, revived from the ancient world and adapted to the
new political reality that was then being shaped, have never since been
questioned.
It was one thing to talk of national assemblies, political rights, and the
separation of powers, but the realities of liberation on the ground looked
rather different. The majority of those who took up arms did so in the name
of their Orthodox Christian faith. The enemy, usually called simply ‘Turks’
in Greek, were identified by their religion, not by what we might term their
ethnicity. At the grassroots level, it was a war of religion.30 The new talk of
Hellenes, Hellas, and the heroes of Marathon and Thermopylae had yet to
filter through to villagers, or even chieftains, who had never learned to read.
When it did, it would remain only a thin veneer for some time. The most
popular slogan under which people fought was ‘Liberty or Death’.
But ‘liberty’, once it began to be achieved, meant rather different things to
the architects of the first constitution, on the one hand, and to the warlords,
who now vied with one another and with the official provisional
government to impose their will upon the local areas they had liberated.
During a relative lull on the external front, in 1823 and 1824, the Greek
Revolution faced its first political test.

On the one side was Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who had chaired the
national assembly and was elected the first president of the executive—in
effect, president of independent Greece. This was the descendant of his
namesake who had served as grand dragoman at the end of the seventeenth
century and had founded one of the most successful dynasties of Phanariots.
The younger Alexandros, one of the few men in revolutionary Greece to
sport a western European frock coat, cut an unheroic figure, standing not
much more than five feet tall, stout, and wearing thick-lensed spectacles for
his myopia. But Mavrokordatos was a consummate politician, master of
eight languages, committed to the humanitarian and secular ideas of the
European Enlightenment, and deeply versed in the political theory and
geopolitics of the day. He had been primarily responsible for the final draft
of the Epidaurus Constitution and had successfully steered its provisions
through the assembly.
On the opposing side, the most powerful among the warlords in the
Peloponnese was Theodoros Kolokotronis, a former brigand and paid
soldier of successive foreign governments in the Ionian Islands. Nicknamed
‘the Old Man of the Morea’ (he was fifty years old when the revolution
began), Kolokotronis was a formidable guerrilla chieftain. By the second
year of the revolution, he had a string of victories to his credit. Among them
was the annihilation of an Ottoman army that had tried and failed to relieve
the besieged garrison in Nafplio and had then been trapped by
Kolokotronis’s men in the narrow pass of Dervenakia, near Corinth, in June
1822. The Scottish historian George Finlay, an eye witness to many of the
events he described and the author of one of the most definitive early
histories of the Greek Revolution, gives this pen portrait:
A large head, a bold countenance, a steady eye, and a profusion of black
hair, gave some dignity to an aspect that did not conceal looks of
cunning and ferocity.… Nurtured as a brigand, he could never
distinguish very clearly right from wrong, justice from injustice; and he
had an instinctive aversion to order and law.31
Conflict between two such different individuals was inevitable. And, of
course, it was a conflict not just between individuals but between whole
concepts of what liberty was going to mean for the Greeks ever after.

Armed conflict broke out between the provisional government and an
alliance of warlords led by Kolokotronis on two separate occasions during
1824. On both occasions, government forces came out on top, with decisive
consequences for the shape of the future Greek state. But both the conflict
and the character of the protagonists have left a profound legacy that has
never entirely gone away since and that would resurface as a fault line in
many different later crises in Greek history.32
By this time, events in Greece were beginning to make an impact abroad.
Those first appeals to Europe had fallen on predictably deaf ears. But if
governments still shunned the insurgents, the same could not be said for
individuals and pressure groups in many countries. Volunteers came from
every corner of the European continent and from as far away as America.
They were known as ‘philhellenes’ (lovers of things Greek). The most
famous of them all was Lord Byron. A high proportion of them died in
Greece, whether in action or, like Byron in April 1824, from disease. Often
these volunteers had to evade the surveillance of their own governments,
which did their best to try to stop them from going. Altogether about twelve
hundred arrived in Greece between 1821 and 1827. But far more numerous,
and in the end a great deal more influential on the outcome of the
revolution, were those philhellenes who stayed at home to organise
committees, pressure groups, and press campaigns in their own countries to
lobby governments and to raise funds in aid of the Greek cause.33
It was very much as a result of these activities that governments abroad
slowly, and usually reluctantly, began to reassess their position towards
Greece. Great Britain was the first to break ranks among the ‘Concert of
Europe’. Early in 1823, George Canning, who had recently been appointed
Foreign Secretary, recognised the captains and crews of Greek ships on the
high seas as legitimate belligerents (rather than as pirates). At the end of the
same year, in the USA, President James Monroe came close to recognising
Greek independence in a famous speech to Congress. Mainly remembered
for setting out the Monroe Doctrine, which defined respective spheres of
influence for Europe and the New World, the presidential address of 2
December also included these words: ‘There is good cause to believe… that
Greece will become again an independent nation. That she may obtain that

rank is the object of our most ardent wishes.’ A little over a year later, a bill
was introduced to Congress that, if it had passed, would have had the same
effect. Even though it failed, public support in America remained strong
enough to allow the fighting frigate Hellas to be built in a New York
shipyard and delivered to the Greek government at the end of 1826.34
In Europe, no government was yet prepared to go so far. In 1824, Tsar
Alexander secretly sounded out the British and French about carving out
‘zones of influence’ for each of them in an autonomous Greece which
would still be nominally subject to the Ottomans. When the tsar’s proposal
was leaked, most of the Greek leaders saw this as a betrayal and turned
instead to Great Britain. Although the British government refused to take
the insurgents under its protection, and while rival Greek factions put out
alternative feelers to both France and Russia, a diplomatic dialogue was
beginning. Greece was firmly on the agenda of the chief maritime powers
of the day.
From the point of view of the Greeks, it was not a moment too soon. By
the time the plea to the British government was issued, on 1 August 1825,
the Ottoman counterattack had begun. Ottoman land forces from the north
were matched by a newly modernised fleet from Alexandria, commanded
by Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the sultan’s vassal, Muhammad Ali of Egypt.
Ibrahim landed on the south coast of the Peloponnese in February 1825.
Over the next two and a half years, the Ottoman army and the Egyptian
fleet between them reversed nearly everything that the Greeks had gained
since 1821. By the early summer of 1827, liberated Hellas had all but
disappeared.
But too many Greeks had struggled for too long to think of going back
now. Ibrahim Pasha, who had been promised the Peloponnese as his reward,
was threatening to kill or enslave the remaining population and people the
entire region with Muslims transported from North Africa. It was not only
Greeks who were galvanised by these threats. Philhellenes throughout the
world had been mobilised by the conviction that this was not just a distant
squabble in a foreign land but that something fundamental to their own
civilisation was at stake. It was becoming more difficult for governments to
ignore them—and this at a time when the fate of Greece was increasingly
becoming a matter of hard-headed geopolitics.

From the spring of 1826, the three Great Powers that had interests in the
eastern Mediterranean—Great Britain, France, and Russia—had embarked
on a delicate series of negotiations, not with the Greeks but with each other.
If Ottoman power was going to be seriously weakened in Europe, it
mattered a great deal to each of the three that neither of the others should
gain a geopolitical advantage from the outcome. This was the diplomatic
dilemma that would in due course become known as the Eastern Question;
it would not finally be resolved until after the First World War. A year later,
in 1827, while Canning was briefly prime minister of Great Britain, the
three powers agreed to send a joint naval taskforce into the Aegean, charged
with enforcing a truce between the belligerents. Not surprisingly, the
Greeks welcomed this sign of military intervention; the Ottomans
repudiated it as an unjustifiable interference in their internal affairs. The
unintended consequence was a naval engagement in Navarino Bay, off the
southwest coast of the Peloponnese, on 20 October 1827. The combined
Ottoman and Egyptian fleets were all but destroyed, and Ibrahim was
forced to abandon the Peloponnese shortly afterwards.
The success of the Greek Revolution, in some form, was now assured. But
the eventual settlement had been taken out of Greek hands. It was now up to
the three Great Powers to find a resolution—though this did not happen
immediately. In the meantime, it was the provisional government of Greece,
and not any external agent, that appointed an interim head of government
for the state that still had no formally recognised existence. His name was
Ioannis Kapodistrias, also known as Count John Capo d’Istria. Originally
an aristocrat from Corfu, he had joined the Russian service and risen to
become joint foreign minister of Russia from 1814 to 1822. Kapodistrias
arrived in the Peloponnese early in 1828, with the title Kyvernitis, which
exactly translates the Latin-derived term ‘governor’.
Kapodistrias was at once an outsider—he had never been to mainland
Greece before—and a Greek. His appointment was accepted by the
representatives of the Great Powers, who were now in charge of the
negotiations for Greece’s future, though for different reasons he was
distrusted by the governments of all three. But at least, from their point of
view, they were dealing with a statesman whose credentials were widely
recognised—Kapodistrias had after all helped to represent Russia at the

Congress of Vienna. His arrival was another significant step towards the
emergence of Greece onto the European stage.
The new governor set about establishing the institutions of the future
nation-state and did his best to negotiate the most favourable terms for
Greece with the representatives of the three Great Powers. But the decisive
breakthrough seems not to have been due to Kapodistrias but rather to the
defeat of the Ottoman Empire by Russia in yet another Russo-Turkish war
in September 1829. The war had been fought mainly in the Caucasus; the
future of the Greeks had not been its main cause. But when Russian troops
came as close to the Ottoman capital as Edirne (Adrianople), even the Duke
of Wellington, at the time prime minister of Britain and no friend to
revolutions in general or to the Greeks in particular, suddenly saw the force
of the Greek point of view: with the Ottoman Empire in decline, only an
independent Greece could serve as a counterweight to Russia in the Balkans
and the Aegean. The decisive moment came on 3 February 1830. A
protocol signed in London on that day, on behalf of the governments of
Great Britain, France, and Russia, declared for the first time, and under
their joint guarantee, that: ‘Greece will form an independent State, and will
enjoy all those rights—political, administrative, and commercial—attached
to complete independence.’35
In October 1831, Kapodistrias was assassinated by two political
opponents as he was entering church in Nafplio. The powers had already
decided that the new state must be a monarchy, not a republic as its
provisional constitution had declared. In May 1832, a new treaty
determined that Prince Otto, the second son of the philhellene king of
Bavaria Ludwig I, would be the first king. Frontiers for the kingdom were
drawn up at the same time. They included only the Peloponnese, less than
half of mainland Greece as it is today, and those islands closest to it in the
Aegean. The remainder was still part of the Ottoman Empire, except for the
Ionian Islands, which had been awarded to Great Britain to rule as a
protectorate in 1815. Neither the Greeks nor the Ottomans had any say in
these decisions.
At the time and for long afterwards, even today, many Greeks have felt
sore at this outcome. What had been won fell some way short of the
absolute ideal of ‘Liberty or Death’ that so many had fought and died for.

On the other hand, the revolution had begun with those appeals to the
conscience of Europe. And if the outcome had little to do with conscience
and everything to do with geopolitical calculation, it also firmly integrated
the newly independent state into the evolving geopolitics of the continent,
and indeed of the wider world. When the future king, Prince Otto, arrived at
Nafplio aboard a British warship on 6 February 1833, Greece (‘Hellas’ in
Greek) was ready to take its place among the political states of Europe—for
the first time in all the long history of the Greeks.

14
EUROPEAN STATE, GLOBAL NATION
1833–1974

N

ot only was Greece a new state on the map of Europe; it was a new kind

of state, the first of many to be created in the name and in the image of a
nation. The model was already being tried out in the New World, in both
North and South America. In Europe, it had been pioneered, abortively, in
France during the Revolution. The idea of what we now call national selfdetermination had been around since the Enlightenment. Europeans
everywhere were aware of its possibilities; its day would dawn later in the
century, in the national ‘unifications’ of Italy and Germany. But Greece,
formally recognised as independent in 1830, was the first experiment in
making it work in the Old World.
Ten years would pass before the new kingdom would be granted a
parliament or a constitution. But even during the ten years of
‘Bavarocracy’, when Otto and his German advisers were accountable to no
one, unless it was to Otto’s father back in Munich, most of the portfolios in
the government and most administrative positions were filled by Greeks.
These were the people who now began to build the foundations of a state
that would be truly modern, European, and above all national.1
To be national meant: to be ‘Hellenic’. As a starting point they took the
‘Greek Revival’, whose example had done so much to bring the state into
existence in the first place. Within months of the arrival of Otto and the
formation of his first government, the decision was taken to move the
capital from Nafplio to Athens. The ruined citadel of the Acropolis,
crowned by the Parthenon, still dominated the plain of Attica, as it had done

ever since the time of Pericles. The modern town at its foot was home at the
time to no more than twelve thousand people. But in the eyes of any
classically educated foreigner, the ruins and the ancient reputation of
Athens encapsulated the very idea of Greece. Athens must become a city
once again, and a fitting capital for a modern state.
3307

14. The expansion of the Greek state (1832–1947)

3307

A whole new street plan was laid out during the 1830s. Its straight lines
and geometric patterns followed Enlightenment principles, which in turn
went back to Hellenistic models and ultimately to Hippodamus of Miletus.
Over the decades to come, the wide straight boulevards of central Athens,
that today are choked with traffic, were driven through derelict houses and
open country. The focal point was to be the Acropolis high above, the new
city laid out in homage to the old. And just about every sign of human
activity during the centuries that separated the decline of the ancient world
from the establishment of the new state was systematically obliterated—
including all the medieval and later buildings on the Acropolis. Almost
every new building, in Athens and many other parts of Greece, too, was
built in the neoclassical style, reviving and perpetuating architectural details
from the time of the ancient city-states. The new Greece was to be
seamlessly welded onto the ruins of its ancient predecessor.2
But there was nothing ancient about the institutions that made all this
possible, and enabled the state to function, even if some of them were given
ancient names. With great vigour, during the 1830s, state institutions were
created that were quite unlike anything that had ever existed before in this
corner of the world. A national army was created. At the top of the national
judicial system was a supreme court, named the Areopagus, after a rather
different institution in ancient Athens. A national currency was introduced
and called the drachma, after an ancient coin, but the monetary system was
organised along entirely modern lines. A blueprint was drawn up for a
national education system. The University of Athens opened its doors in
1837, named at first after the monarch and then, from 1862, as the National
University. The Hill of the Nymphs, overlooking the site of the ancient
Agora, was crowned in 1842 by the National Observatory on its summit—
the claims of modern science were made early. There was even a national
version of the Orthodox Church. The Autocephalous Church of Greece for
a number of years cut all its ties with the patriarchate in Constantinople,
which of course was obliged to remain an Ottoman, as well as a Christian,
institution.
The obstacles to making all this work were formidable. The new state had
only about six hundred thousand inhabitants, no natural resources, and an
agricultural economy that had been ruined by more than ten years of

conflict. It was already heavily in debt to the guarantor powers. Back in
1827, the provisional government had defaulted on two loans that had been
raised from private speculators on the London stock market to keep the
provisional government afloat in 1824 and 1825. None of the centres of
Greek education that had flourished during the previous century lay within
its borders; few of its citizens, beyond the elite, could read or write. Hardly
a building, in most towns and villages, had escaped damage during the
revolution; many lay derelict.
Given these challenges, it is all the more remarkable how much was
achieved during the three decades of Otto’s reign. Endemic problems
remained. Many ‘national’ institutions still had the appearance of a
European veneer laid over traditional ways of behaviour that would take
decades, yet, to change. Brigandage was rife in the countryside. Outside the
centre of Athens, far more people still dressed in the traditional Ottoman
style than a la franka (meaning, in the European way). A telling detail is
that the national currency, the drachma, did not fully oust the Ottoman
piastre until the 1870s. The constitution belatedly granted in 1844 was way
ahead of its time, at least in theory, in the breadth of the franchise it offered
to citizens.3 But much of this would remain a dead letter until its successor
came into force twenty years later—and women would have to wait until
1952 to vote in parliamentary elections in Greece. New foreign debts
incurred at the time of independence, as well as the sometimes blatant
interference of the ‘protector’ powers, would severely curtail the
sovereignty that had been promised by the founding treaties until well into
the twentieth century.
Otto loved his adopted country, but his subjects only occasionally warmed
to him. They deposed him in a second coup d’état in 1862. King Otto I (and
last) of Greece departed, as he had arrived, aboard a ship of the British
Royal Navy, to live out his days back in Bavaria. But despite the
frustrations of Otto’s reign, the Greek state had proved itself a ‘new model
kingdom in the east’, in the words of its second monarch, the Danish prince
who would be crowned as King George I of the Hellenes in the following
year.4
A form of vindication came a generation later. In the 1890s, the Olympic
Games were revived as a modern international athletic contest. The

initiative came not from Greece but from a French sports enthusiast and
educational reformer by the name of Baron Pierre de Coubertin. But with
strong support from the Greek royal family (who of course were not
ethnically Greek either) and leading Greek intellectuals, the city chosen to
host the first modern Olympics was Athens. In April 1896, contestants and
spectators from all over the world were won over by the splendid
neoclassical buildings and wide-open spaces. The Panathenaic Stadium,
originally built in the time of Lycurgus in the fourth century BCE, was
restored in gleaming new marble, cut from the same quarries that had been
used for the original construction. An additional boost to Greek morale
came in the final event, the marathon race, which had been devised
specially for the occasion, to re-create the twenty-six-mile forced march of
the Athenian army after the battle in 490 BCE and was won by a Greek
former soldier called Spyridon Louis.5
But Greeks knew very well, as the nineteenth century drew towards a close,
that the kingdom in which many of them took such pride was only one part
of a far wider Greek-speaking world. At the time of independence, at least
three times as many people who could be reckoned as Greeks had been
living outside Greece as lived within it. Since then, the state had modestly
expanded. The Ionian Islands had been ceded by Great Britain in 1864;
Thessaly and part of Epiros, by the Ottomans in 1881. The population had
quadrupled in the same period, to just under two and a half million in 1896.
But the number of those living in the Ottoman Empire, in southern Russia,
and in emigrant communities on four continents, although no precise means
existed to count them, was probably between three and four million.6
Even though the state now had a national capital of its own, many both
inside and outside Greece throughout the nineteenth century continued to
look on Constantinople, not Athens, as the true capital of their nation. One
way of resolving the dilemma would be a much more ambitious expansion
of the state. And so was born what came to be known as the ‘Grand Idea’.
Often said to be the brainchild of Ioannis Kolettis, a veteran politician
who had played a leading part in the Revolution, in a speech delivered in
1844, this ‘Idea’ was in fact as old as the Greek state itself, and indeed
inseparable from its very existence. Exactly what it might mean in practice

and by what means it might be achieved were the subject of endless debate;
many competing versions existed. In its fullest form, the Grand Idea
envisioned a restoration of the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at
Constantinople. But at its heart lay the aspiration to expand the borders of
the Greek state so as to bring as much as possible of the nation within them.
In one form or another, this aspiration became the basis for almost all the
foreign and much of the domestic policy of every Greek government from
the late 1830s to the beginning of the 1920s. And it was not confined to the
elite; the Idea seems to have been very widely shared by Greeks in all walks
of life, at least among those living in Greece.7
Beyond the borders of the state, attitudes varied. In Crete, and some other
islands that had a majority Greek population, union with the Greek
kingdom across the sea was a goal worth dying for. Revolts in Crete broke
out in every decade of the century, from 1821 onwards, under the banner of
‘Union or Death’. But elsewhere, Greek communities seem to have been
more ambivalent. In Macedonia and Epiros, which bordered the kingdom to
the north, and farther east in Thrace, Greek speakers lived cheek by jowl
with speakers of Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian, and Albanian, as well as
Muslim Turks. Disentangling these mixed populations would prove a long
and sometimes bloody business; in the nineteenth century, what we now
call ‘national consciousness’ was only just beginning. Farther afield, if you
lived in Trebizond or Caesarea (modern Kayseri) in Cappadocia, you would
learn in a Greek school that you and your family were ‘Hellenes’ and
belonged to an ancient nation whose fortunes were now reviving. But the
simple facts of geography must make it very improbable that your
homeland would ever become part of a political state governed from
Athens.
We have all too little information on the opinions of rank-and-file Greeks
living in the Ottoman Empire during this time. But we do know that
throughout the nineteenth century, individual Greeks and family networks,
based far outside the kingdom, were making their mark on the world, quite
independently of the Greek state. Greek shipping and trading networks,
whose origins can be traced all the way back to the explosion of activity in
Constantinople, Smyrna, Venice, and Crete during the sixteenth century,
had expanded hugely during the eighteenth and now began to reach out

even farther. It has been argued that their methods, and their business
model, would play a formative part in shaping the international trading
systems that today we call ‘global’.8
Typical of a new breed of entrepreneurs were the three Vagliano brothers,
born on the Ionian island of Cephalonia. With one based in Taganrog on the
Sea of Azov, another in London, and the third in the French Mediterranean
port of Marseille, they oversaw a commercial network that exported goods
from Russia and central Asia by way of the Russian ports on the Sea of
Azov and the Black Sea right across the Mediterranean and as far as Paris,
Rotterdam, London, and Manchester, bringing back manufactured goods on
their return. By the time the last of the brothers died (Panagi Vagliano, in
London, in 1902), the combined value of their estate was equal to almost
half of the total gross national product of Greece.9
Other family-run firms reached even farther. The five Ralli brothers, born
into a family originally from Chios, had set up operations in London during
the Greek Revolution in 1823. Pandia Ralli, described as the ‘brain’ of the
firm, remained in London; in later life he would become Sir Pandia, known
with affectionate awe as ‘Zeus’. With offices on four continents during the
middle years of the century, the Ralli family became the most prominent
among some sixty well-to-do Greek families established in London, all of
them originating from Chios. Their island had been devastated in 1822
during the Revolution; most had set out on their business careers with
almost nothing. Throughout the latter part of the nineteenth century and
beyond, these families formed a close-knit community, many of them living
within a few hundred yards of each other in London’s Finsbury Park,
frequently intermarrying, but also integrating to an unusual degree for an
immigrant community into British high society. Their graves in West
Norwood Cemetery in South London, many of them in grand mausolea
designed in the neoclassical style, are a permanent and moving testimony to
the public successes and private griefs of a world that has otherwise
vanished.10
Fortunes were being made elsewhere, too. In Constantinople, during the
second half of the century, out of a city population of just over one million,
approximately a quarter were Greeks. Only a generation after the
liquidation of the Phanariots in 1821, sweeping reforms in the Ottoman

Empire had brought new opportunities for non-Muslims to take part in
public life, to organise the education of their own communities, and, for the
Greeks in particular, to build even further on the commercial successes of
earlier generations. By the 1870s, Constantinopolitan Greeks had largely
created the Ottoman banking system; even the sultan banked with Greek
firms. Greek financiers based in Constantinople were the main source of
inward investment in the Greek state during the latter part of the century.
One of their number, Andreas Syngros, would later be remembered as a
benefactor and philanthropist in Greece after he moved to Athens in 1870s.
But Syngros was the exception; the majority preferred to stay where they
were—which was where the opportunities lay.11
Another success story at this time was Egypt. Since the beginning of the
century, Greek entrepreneurs had begun moving there in large numbers to
exploit the possibilities of the cotton trade that was then opening up. When
the American Civil War in the 1860s closed the Atlantic trade in cotton,
these Greek businesses, based in Alexandria and Cairo, began to make
money on a scale unimaginable in the constrained conditions of
independent Greece. One of the most famous Greek businessmen in Egypt
was Emmanuel Benakis, who presided over the community in Alexandria at
the beginning of the twentieth century. Like Syngros, Benakis is better
remembered today than most of his peers because he elected to move with
his family to Athens, where he became the city’s mayor in 1914. Benakis’s
son, the art collector Antonis, would give his name and his collection to
today’s Benaki Museum in Athens.12
It wasn’t only in business and finance that Greeks outside the kingdom
were achieving things that few of its citizens would even have dreamt of
doing at home. At the turn of the twentieth century, and for some decades
afterwards, some of the most influential literary periodicals that circulated
in the Greek-speaking world were published in Alexandria. It was there,
between the 1890s and his death in 1933, that Constantine Cavafy honed
the unique poetic voice that would establish him as by far the best-known
and the most frequently translated of all the poets of ‘modern Greece’.
Cavafy was born in Alexandria, into a Greek family from Constantinople,
whose fortune had been made, but subsequently lost, in the cotton trade. He
rarely visited Greece and didn’t greatly like what he saw when he did.

Indeed, part of his youth had been spent in Liverpool and in London, close
to the heart of the community dominated by Sir Pandia Ralli. Cavafy’s
achievement was to imagine a Greek world centred upon his native city,
that had been founded by Macedonians on Egyptian soil more than two
thousand years before. More than half of his published poems evoke
moments snatched from that history, during periods when the Greek
language and Greek culture had been diffused right across the eastern
Mediterranean and the Middle East. Cavafy’s take on this whole sweep of
history is quintessentially at odds with a national narrative that, ever since
the 1820s, has given priority to the Greek state. Imaginatively, in his verse,
he celebrates and with self-deprecating irony participates in a narrative of
Greek cultural superiority that goes all the way back to Thucydides and
Isocrates.
The often-quoted pen portrait of Cavafy, drawn by the English novelist E.
M. Forster, who met him in Alexandria in 1917, goes to the heart of an
identity that must have been shared by very many educated Greeks of the
time. Their mental horizons had been shaped far from Greece, but they
would still take a deep, indeed a patriotic, pride in belonging to a much
more broadly based Hellenic nation:
He was a loyal Greek, but Greece for him was not territorial.… Racial
purity bored him, so did political idealism. And he could be caustic
about the tight-lipped little peninsula overseas.… The civilisation he
respected was a bastardy in which the Greek strain prevailed, and into
which, age after age, outsiders would push, to modify and be
modified.13
In the spring of 1897, Greece went to war against the Ottoman Empire. For
a heady few weeks, enthusiastic crowds in Athens cheered the
accomplishment of the Grand Idea. The Greeks would take back
Constantinople; the emperor ‘turned to marble’, Constantine XI, who had
died fighting on the ramparts of his capital, would return to life and lead his
people to victory; the Turks would be despatched back to central Asia
where they had come from. What happened was very nearly the opposite.
Within a month, the Greek army was in full retreat, pursued by Ottoman

forces that could well have reached Athens if the guarantor powers had not
stepped in to enforce the terms of Greek independence. The humiliation of
this defeat was felt throughout the kingdom. Even the well-respected King
George and the royal family came in for unprecedented abuse. But then, as
one apologist for the campaign insisted shortly after it was over, ‘It was the
state that had been defeated and not the nation.’14
The Grand Idea now had to be rethought. Which mattered more: to
preserve the integrity of the state, or to liberate the nation? The issue had
become more complicated now that all the other inhabitants of the Balkan
Peninsula had begun to emulate the Greek example and create new nationstates of their own. Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro had gained formal
recognition in 1878; a Bulgarian principality was on the way to statehood,
fully achieved in 1908; Albania would soon follow. All these new states had
their own versions of the Grand Idea, because communities speaking their
respective languages lived deeply interspersed throughout the southern
Balkans. Meanwhile, the contested regions, known by their ancient names
of Epiros, Macedonia, and Thrace, were all still part of the Ottoman
Empire. So the stage was set for a three-, four-, or even five-way tussle.
The First Balkan War broke out in October 1912. Greece had a new prime
minister, a lawyer who had cut his teeth in his native Crete, where the longprized goal of union with Greece had still not been achieved. His name was
Eleftherios Venizelos, and he would prove to be one of the most successful
and also divisive leaders in modern Greek history. An admirer who met him
shortly before this time would later record his first impressions:
He seemed to shine, he was transparent, like alabaster, with the
complexion of a young girl from northern climes, strangely framed by a
beard with the first sparse white hairs. The spectacles added to the
brightness, but still more the two blue-green phosphorescent eyes, which
seemed to come out from behind the glasses and look directly at you.15
Venizelos was perhaps the only Greek politician of modern times to gain
respect abroad as a statesman of world stature. At home, for his supporters
he was nothing short of a Messiah. To his enemies (and they were many) he
was a ‘false prophet’, inspired by the devil himself. Many, at the time and

ever since, have held Venizelos personally responsible for the greatest
disaster ever to befall the Greek state.16
After he became prime minister for the first time in 1910, Venizelos
applied himself to making the Grand Idea a reality, despite the setbacks of
the decade before. Under his stewardship, the economy recovered strongly
and investments could be made in the armed forces, as well as in
infrastructure and public services. New diplomatic overtures among the
competing nation-states of the Balkans at the same time brought about an
unexpected alliance against the Ottoman Empire. The first blow was struck
by tiny Montenegro, on the Adriatic coast, on 8 October 1912. Within days,
Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia had joined in. A Greek army led by Crown
Prince Constantine entered Thessalonica on 8 November, only hours ahead
of a Bulgarian force that had been racing to reach the same goal. The
Ottomans were driven back to within a few miles of their capital.
Less than a year later, the fragile alliance fragmented. A Second Balkan
War, fought in July 1913, rearranged the pieces on the board: Greece and
the Ottoman Empire both made gains at the expense of Bulgaria, which had
come out as the biggest winner in the first round. By the end of 1913, the
frontiers of Greece had been extended to the north, east, and south (to
include Crete), almost to where they lie today. The land area of the kingdom
had increased by more than half; its population had almost doubled to 4.8
million. Was the next stop to be Constantinople?17
But then, in 1914, came yet another war. This one, too, began in the
Balkans, with the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne while on a
visit to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, on 28 June. In early August, wider
hostilities were declared. This latest Balkan conflict was about to become
the Great War, or the ‘war to end all wars’, later to be known as the First
World War. On one side was the Triple Entente, consisting of the empires of
Great Britain, France, and Russia; on the other, the Central Powers, namely,
the German Reich, the empire of Austria-Hungary, and from October the
Ottoman Empire, too.
What was the Greek government to do? If Greece were to enter the war on
the side of the Entente, an estimated two million Greeks, living in Ottoman
territory as Ottoman subjects, would be effectively held hostage. On the
other hand, if the Entente were to win, and if Greece had contributed to the

defeat of its arch enemy, these Ottoman Greeks could be liberated and their
homelands incorporated into a greater Greece. Venizelos, the prime
minister, was for joining the war on the side of the Entente; the former
crown prince, who was now Constantine I and married to the sister of
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, was for staying neutral.
In 1915, Great Britain and France began to force the issue by landing
troops in Thessalonica so as to defend their Balkan ally, Serbia. Further
violations of Greek sovereignty followed. Greeks in all walks of life were
more bitterly divided than they had ever been since the days of the internal
conflicts during the Revolution. These divisions were so bitter because the
argument was fundamentally not about international alliances or the world
war at all, but between the interests of the nation and the interests of the
state. The old fault line from the 1820s had emerged in a new guise to pit
one version of Greek patriotism against another.
In September 1916, Venizelos defied the king and set up an alternative
government in Thessalonica. He justified his actions with the declaration:
The Nation is called, in the absence of the State, to answer a national
emergency.… Whereas the State has betrayed its obligations, it remains
to the Nation to act in order to achieve the task assigned to the State.18
For the next eight months, the country had two rival governments, one led
by the king in Athens, the other by Venizelos in Thessalonica. Under this
pressure, open civil war broke out on the streets of Athens in December
1916. Six months later, with the support of French troops, Venizelos finally
prevailed. King Constantine was forced into exile, Venizelos returned to
Athens to head a government of reunified Greece, and Greek troops
contributed to the final battles on the Macedonian front that helped to bring
the war to an end in 1918.
Once the war was over, and the Entente had indeed won, Venizelos
exercised all his considerable talents as a statesman at the ensuing Peace
Conference in Paris. The result was to be two huge gains for Greece. The
first was the right to land troops in Smyrna and to occupy the surrounding
administrative district in May 1919. Then the Treaty of Sèvres, signed in
the French town of that name in August 1920, awarded to Greece large
swathes of Ottoman territory in eastern Thrace and western Anatolia. With

the longer-term future of Constantinople still to be resolved, it was even
possible that one day the capital city founded by Constantine, which had
never ceased to be the symbolic capital of the Greek-speaking world, might
again be ruled by Greeks.
It was a tragic miscalculation. Venizelos and his policy suffered a double
defeat: at home, in a parliamentary election held in November 1920, but
more critically in Anatolia at the hands of the newly created Turkish
Nationalist movement led by Mustafa Kemal, later known as Atatürk, the
founder of the modern Republic of Turkey. The election result in Greece
brought the exiled King Constantine back to his throne. Because of the
king’s stance during the world war, Britain and France withdrew all the
diplomatic and financial support they had been giving while Venizelos
remained in charge. The new government would have to go it alone. In
1921, Greek forces in Anatolia pushed eastwards in a preemptive strike
against Kemal’s provisional capital, Ankara. When that failed, the stalemate
that followed lasted for a year. Then in September 1922, the Turks broke
through the Greek lines, the Greek army withdrew to the coast and was
evacuated to Greece. The Greek population of Anatolia was now left to its
fate. The city of Smyrna, where Greeks had made up the largest part of the
population for several decades, was devastated by fire within days of the
arrival of Kemal’s army.
The defeat of the Greek army in Anatolia, after a three-year campaign, has
ever since been remembered by Greeks as the ‘Asia Minor Catastrophe’
(after the ancient name of the subcontinent, still current in Greek), or
simply the ‘Catastrophe’. The Greek state had expanded its borders, but to
an extent far less than had been envisaged by enthusiasts for the Grand
Idea. The price had been the permanent uprooting of the Greek nation from
eastern Thrace, from all round the Sea of Marmara, from the Black Sea
coast of Trebizond and its hinterland, from the Aegean coast as far south as
Smyrna, and from Cappadocia in central Anatolia. These ‘lost homelands’,
as they are still remembered by Greeks today, had been home to Greek
speakers for centuries, if not for millennia, and had once made up the
heartland of the Byzantine Empire.19
Over the next few months, uncounted thousands of Greeks were either
killed or taken prisoner. In the aftermath, between 1.3 and 1.4 million

Orthodox Christians, almost all of them Greek-speaking, permanently lost
their homes. Those who had not already fled during the last months of 1922
were evacuated to Greece as part of a compulsory exchange of populations
that was negotiated under the auspices of the League of Nations at the
Convention of Lausanne in January 1923. The task of housing and
assimilating so many refugees, with assistance from international bodies
such as the League and the Red Cross, has often and justly been reckoned
as one of the outstanding successes of the Greek state in its two-hundredyear history. But it was also, inevitably, a story of human loss, tragedy, and
bitterness. If the immediate crisis was largely over by 1930—when, even
more surprisingly, a government once again led by Venizelos was able to
normalise relations with Kemal’s new Turkey—it would take another five
decades, at least, for the incomers to be fully assimilated.20
In the aftermath, artists and intellectuals agonised over the nature and
meaning of what they called ‘Greekness’, or ‘Hellenicity’. A generation of
poets, novelists, painters, philosophers, and historians grappled with the
challenge: How was it possible, in this new world, to be at once Greek and
modern? ‘Greece is travelling, always travelling’, wrote the poet George
Seferis in 1936:
and we do not realise, do not realise we’re all of us sailors turfed
ashore
do not realise how bitter is the port when all the ships put out to sea;
we laugh at those who do.
Seferis, who was himself an exile from his native Smyrna, took exception
to the very term ‘Hellenicity’, which he saw as a form of stereotyping. In an
essay published in 1938, he urged future generations ‘to seek the truth…
not by asking how to be Greek, but with the conviction that since they are
Greek, the work that they will truly produce cannot be anything other than
Greek’.21
The novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, written in the early 1940s and known in
translation as Zorba the Greek, addresses the same question (though it is
about a great deal else as well). ‘Lots of people are patriots for what they

can get out of it,’ says the title character. ‘I’m not a patriot, and too bad if I
get nothing out of it.… If I hear the Greeks have taken Constantinople, it’s
the same to me as if the Turks have taken Athens’.22 The fictional Zorba is
anything but a typical ‘modern Greek’, as generations of readers of the
novel in translation have supposed. Kazantzakis in his fiction, like Seferis
in his essay, was casting about to discover a new Greek identity, and in the
process helping to create one.
Successive governments during the 1920s and 1930s were much less
successful in what was, essentially, the same quest. With the exception of
the four-year administration of Venizelos, from 1928 to 1932, governments
came and went, as often installed by one or other faction of a divided
military as by the ballot box. Politically, the divisions of the previous
decade obstinately refused to heal. Even the normally statesmanlike
Venizelos was not above stoking them as his grip on power weakened in the
early 1930s. The monarchy had been replaced by a republic in 1924, but
was then reinstated eleven years later. In 1936, a political impasse enabled a
former general, Ioannis Metaxas, to establish a dictatorship. During the next
five years, the cult of the state became a fetish. The rhetoric of the Metaxas
regime often echoed that of Hitler’s Third Reich and Fascist Italy under
Mussolini. A ‘Third Greek Civilisation’ was proclaimed, and young Greeks
were told to emulate the attitudes and achievements not of democratic, artsloving Athens but of the tightly controlled militarist state of ancient Sparta.
As Europe stumbled towards a second world war, some speculated that
Metaxas might even join the German-Italian Axis.23
Even after the Catastrophe of 1922, and despite the rhetoric of some in
government at home, the story of the Greek state could never be the whole
story of the Greek nation. For all the brutal simplicity of the compulsory
exchange of populations, there remained untidy edges, and therefore
unfinished business, in parts of the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean
which for centuries had been part of the Greek-speaking world. Exceptions
had been allowed for the Greeks of Istanbul, who at the time numbered
approximately one hundred thousand, and the small communities on the
islands of Imbros and Tenedos (Gökçeada and Bozcaada) which
strategically guard the strait of the Dardanelles and had been demanded by

Turkey as part of the settlement. In return, a Muslim and mostly Turkishspeaking community had been allowed to remain in the Greek province of
western Thrace—and to this day is the only officially recognised ethnic
minority in Greece.
Elsewhere, in regions that had passed out of Ottoman control before the
exchange, Greeks still remained the majority population and of course were
not affected by it. This was the case with the Northern Epirots who lived (as
do some of their descendants to this day) in the southern part of Albania.
The islands of the Dodecanese had been annexed by Italy in 1912 and
would have to wait until after the Second World War to become part of the
Greek state. Largest, and in the event the most politically significant, was
Cyprus. Administered by Great Britain since 1878, the island became
formally a Crown Colony in 1925. The 80 per cent of its population who
were Greek Orthodox and spoke the Cypriot dialect of Greek had long
cherished the notion that Cyprus would one day become part of Greece. But
maintaining good relations with Britain counted for more with successive
Greek governments, and the issue would remain sidelined in Greece until
the Cypriots themselves took the initiative in the 1950s.
In the meantime, Greeks who had been branching out to establish
communities in other parts of the world were consolidating their position.
In Egypt, effectively under British rule from 1882 until after the Second
World War, the Greek community reached its peak in the 1930s, when it
numbered about a hundred thousand. Not only from their prominent role in
the cotton trade but also as pilots for ships using the Suez Canal, the
‘Egyptiots’, as Greek Egyptians are known in Greek, have been credited
with contributing significantly to modernizing their host country. Their
status there was somewhere in the middle between the British rulers and the
native Arab-speaking Egyptians, and to some extent they were in a position
to act as mediators between them.24
Beyond Europe and the Mediterranean, Greeks had been setting out to
create new homes and new lives for themselves in the United States since
the last decade of the nineteenth century. By the time that US legislation put
a stop to large-scale immigration in the early 1920s, just over half a million
Greeks had crossed the Atlantic. The great majority of those were young
single men; many hoped to make a quick fortune and return home to marry

and settle down, back in Greece. But soon Greek brides-to-be were taking
ship to join husbands they had never seen in marriages that had been
arranged by relatives through letters and photographs. While many did
return, sometimes after a whole working life spent in the United States,
many more stayed and made their homes in their new country. Almost all of
these immigrants had started out in manual trades, often as miners or
railroad workers. But within a generation they were proving themselves
remarkably upwardly mobile and would soon be found mostly in cities or
larger towns, running their own businesses and making the most of the
educational opportunities offered by their new homeland.25
America was also the latest continent on which multinational Greekowned businesses flourished during the first half of the twentieth century
and beyond, despite the upheavals back home. The First World War and the
revolution in Russia in 1917 had changed the focus of their operations,
away from the Black Sea and the Mediterranean into the Atlantic. By the
end of the 1930s, Greek-owned cargo shipping was working its way up the
world league table and had reached ninth place, ahead of such great
shipping nations as Japan and Norway.26
By that time, a new figure had entered the closed and competitive circles
of Greek shipowners: the legendary Aristotle Onassis. Displaced to Greece
from his native Smyrna in 1922, the young Onassis moved on quickly to the
other side of the world. The foundations for his business empire were laid
in Argentina, where a Greek immigrant community had been growing for
more than a century. Later, he would move the base of his operations to the
United States, then to Monaco—but not to Greece. His was to prove the
most spectacular rags-to-riches story of them all. And, like so many other
Greek success stories in the world of business and particularly of shipping,
it had very little to do with the Greek state. In the twentieth century, no less
than in the nineteenth, Greek fortunes were being made elsewhere.
Greece entered the Second World War on 28 October 1940. The Italian
dictator, Benito Mussolini, had annexed Albania the year before. Now,
allied with Hitler’s Germany, which had just overrun most of mainland
Europe, Mussolini sent a telegram to Metaxas demanding unhindered
access to Greece for his troops. When it came to it, Metaxas was more

patriot than fascist (though he was both). In the early hours of that morning,
he said ‘no’: ochi in Greek, an event still commemorated in the national
holiday known as Ochi Day. After that, for six heady months, the deep
divisions within the Greek state were set aside. Fighting in terrible
conditions in the snow and freezing temperatures of the Albanian
mountains in winter, the Greek army and air force pushed the Italians back.
By March 1941, they had won the first victory over the Axis in the whole
course of the Second World War. But in April, Hitler came to the help of his
struggling Axis partner. Unable to stand against the German Third Reich,
the Greek army surrendered. Greece was parcelled out among the
occupying forces of Germany, Italy, and Hitler’s Balkan ally, Bulgaria.
Metaxas, in his seventies and in failing health, had died three months
earlier. What was left of the Greek government, headed by King George II,
escaped into exile, first in London and later in Cairo. The Occupation
authorities appointed an army general to head a puppet government in
Athens; but it was powerless to prevent the Nazis from looting the country
while almost the entire apparatus of the state collapsed. The whole house of
cards, as it had been built up, painstakingly, since the disaster of 1922, came
crashing down. Markets, the currency, and mechanisms for distribution and
supply collapsed. During the first winter of the Occupation, as many as
forty thousand civilians may have died from starvation in Athens and
Piraeus alone. Between 1941 and 1943 the victims of famine are estimated
to have reached a quarter of a million, close to 5 per cent of the total
population.27
With the breakdown of civil society came a return to extreme violence, of
a kind that had not been seen in Greece since the days of the Revolution in
the 1820s. Organised resistance began in the mountains of the mainland in
1942. But almost from the beginning, it was not just a matter of fighting
against the invaders. The Hellenic Popular Liberation Army, known by its
Greek initials ELAS, by 1944 had as many as fifty thousand men under its
command. The political leadership behind the movement belonged to the
Communist Party, which had been outlawed by Metaxas. But not everyone
who determined to take up arms and fight for freedom was prepared to sign
up to this agenda. Just as had happened in the 1820s, incompatible ideas of

liberty brought rival passions into conflict. Competing guerrilla groups took
to the mountains, too.
Terror tactics were used by all parties, against the occupiers and against
each other, while summary executions and the destruction of whole villages
on the orders of Italian and German commanders intensified the cycle of
violence still further. In a bizarre twist towards the end of 1943, thousands
of Greeks took up arms against the resistance organised by ELAS and
ended up taking orders from the Nazis. They then attacked fellow Greeks
on the grounds that they were communists. Denounced at the time as
‘fascists’ and ‘collaborators’, these people can surely have been no more
ideologically attracted to the doctrines of Hitler and Mussolini than most of
the rank-and-file ELAS knew or cared about communism. All sides were
simply fighting to survive in a failed state and to preserve what they could
of what they valued, when even the forces of occupation could barely keep
order outside the major cities, and only by terrorizing the citizens with
arbitrary arrests and mass executions.28
The last German troops left mainland Greece in October 1944. The
government in exile returned, but even with British military support proved
incapable of governing a divided country. Civil war erupted on the streets of
Athens in December. For half a century after that, the old fault line running
through Greek society became aligned with the new geopolitical division of
the postwar world, into a capitalist West and a communist East. The Greek
communists were forced to lay down their arms in January 1945, but the
‘battle for Athens’ had been closely fought, with horrific atrocities on both
sides. Not even the end of World War II later that year was enough to stave
off a full-scale civil war in Greece. On one side was a communist-led
Democratic Army that was the successor to ELAS; on the other,
government forces backed by Britain and then, from 1947 onwards, by the
USA.29
It ended in October 1949, when the last strongholds of the Democratic
Army were overrun in the mountain ranges bordering Greece’s newly
communist neighbours Albania and Yugoslavia. The government in Athens
had won largely thanks to American firepower and economic support. The
consequence was that instead of following the rest of eastern Europe into
the Communist bloc dominated by Soviet Russia, and somewhat in defiance

of geography, Greece became part of the ‘West’ for the duration of the Cold
War, joining the NATO alliance (along with Turkey) in 1951.
During the ‘traumatic decade’ of the 1940s, it has been reckoned that
some two hundred thousand Greeks may have lost their lives or been forced
into exile—a number that does not include the eighty thousand Jewish
victims of the Holocaust, citizens of the Greek state deported and murdered
by the Nazis in 1943 and 1944.30 In the final stages of the civil war,
thousands of Greeks, many of them children, either fled or were forcibly
taken across the country’s northern border. Branded as communists back
home, they and their children would have to make new homes behind the
Iron Curtain in eastern Europe. Many who ended up in Russia would be
resettled by the Soviet authorities in Tashkent, in Uzbekistan. Some of their
descendants remain in all these countries to this day.
Once it was over, many more left Greece voluntarily to seek new
opportunities and security as far from home as it was possible to go—in the
Southern Hemisphere. Some joined an already thriving community in South
Africa. The largest number, about a quarter of a million, set out for
Australia. Most of those settled in the states of New South Wales and
Victoria. It is as a consequence of the Greek Civil War that, since the 1950s,
the third largest Greek city in the world has been Melbourne.31
As the 1940s drew to a close, the Greek state lay in ruins. Everything
would now have to be rebuilt, from the ground up. And, remarkably, it was.
Much of the credit for this, initially, must go to the programme for
economic recovery in Europe approved by the US Congress in April 1948
and known as the Marshall Plan. During the next four years, more than one
billion dollars were disbursed in aid to Greece. Seen as a bulwark in eastern
Europe against the Communist bloc in the Cold War, the country benefited
enormously from military and economic aid from America until the 1970s.
During the 1950s and 1960s, new industries were established, while old
ones, including the staple, agriculture, were modernised. Gross domestic
product increased by an average of 6.5 per cent per year. The initial impetus
might have been American, but this was very much a success story built by
Greeks themselves.32

It was during those decades that Onassis and a new generation of
shipowners came into their own. The Second World War had completely
decimated the worldwide Greek shipping fleet. Vessels had been
requisitioned, or sunk, or both. By 1946, when Greece was on its knees and
about to embark on the final, bloodiest round of its civil war, the Greek
shipowning firms were in scarcely better shape. What saved them was the
offer of loans from a US government keen to offload a fleet of cargo ships
that had been cheaply mass-produced during the war. The result was an
investment that would pay off many times over. But Onassis was aiming
higher still. In the 1950s, he launched a fleet of some of the largest tankers
in the world.33
Within a few years, not only had Onassis become the ‘King of Tankers’
and one of the world’s richest men, but in 1968 he married the widow of US
president John Kennedy, and she became Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Now based in Monaco, but with a string of homes around the world,
Onassis owned a private islet in the Ionian group of islands, Skorpios,
where he would be buried when he died in 1975. Together with another new
entrant to the Greek shipowning fold, his brother-in-law and most bitter
rival, Stavros Niarchos, Onassis built upon business practices that had been
developed by Greek dynasties over several centuries to create a trading
empire that was at once global and, in its own distinctive way, Greek.34
Ships would more usually fly other flags than the Greek blue-and-white
cross and stripes. This was a legacy that went back to the days before there
was such a thing as a Greek national flag—not just to the immediate origins
of these shipping dynasties in the eighteenth century but all the way back to
the time, back in the sixteenth, when Greek merchants and captains had
begun to negotiate their way between the two opposed worlds of the
Ottoman Empire and Christian Europe. Onassis was by no means alone
among Greek shipowners after the Second World War in flagging his
vessels in low-tax states around the world, particularly Panama and Liberia.
On the other hand, just like the poet Cavafy in Alexandria, early in the
century, these were ‘patriotic Greeks’, proud of their Hellenic heritage.
Businesses with a global reach and a huge annual turnover were run on
strictly family lines. Positions of trust were limited to close family
members, and outsiders carefully integrated through arranged marriages.

Management and ships’ crews would include a high proportion of Greeks,
often recruited from the island where the family had originated. The loyalty
of employees to the Onassis firm was as enduring a part of the legend as the
flags of convenience and the giant tankers. Once upon a time the Vaglianos,
who rarely set foot there, had provided for an entire, unofficial system of
social security in their native Cephalonia in the days when the state could
offer nothing like it. On neighbouring Ithaca, several generations owed their
employment and their prosperity to Onassis. This was the result of a
visceral and deeply traditional sense of belonging to a community. But the
community was a very different thing from the state. Greek shipping
fortunes have always been securely banked offshore, well beyond the reach
of the Greek state.35
Culturally, Greece was booming, too, during the 1960s. A new
homegrown film industry, based on small-scale private enterprise, produced
low-budget, mass-market films, shot mostly in black and white. The
number of films produced rivalled the output of Hollywood at the same
time when measured in proportion to the size of the population. Summer
outdoor cinemas became so popular that the rate of cinemagoing in Greece
was the highest in Europe. Many of these films are still treasured as classics
by Greek TV viewers and buyers of DVDs today. Two that were made
partly in English have kept their place in the international repertoire: Never
on a Sunday, directed by American-born Jules Dassin with Melina
Mercouri in the lead role, and Zorba the Greek, based on Kazantzakis’s
novel and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, who had been born in Cyprus
and educated in England. The 1960s also saw the heyday of Greek popular
music, with the bouzouki, an instrument traditionally beloved of the urban
underclass, elevated by composers Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis
Theodorakis into the vehicle for a musical style that would soon become a
Greek trademark around the world. And in 1963, Greece received its first
Nobel Prize—for literature, awarded to the poet George Seferis.36
But once again, just as had happened during the 1930s, economic and
artistic innovation went hand in hand with political deadlock. By the middle
of the decade, street demonstrations and politically motivated strikes were
paralysing city life. An election due to be held in April 1967 was widely

expected to result in victory for the Centre Left. On 21 April, nine days
before polling day, a group of middle-ranking army officers seized power in
a coup d’état. They relied on a plan that had been drawn up by the
Americans to secure the country in the event of war with the Soviets. It
worked with scarcely a hitch. Tanks replaced traffic in the streets.
Parliament was dissolved and civil rights suspended. Dissidents were
subjected to arbitrary arrest, torture, and long prison sentences. The music
of Theodorakis, a known supporter of the banned Communist Party, was
prohibited; another Communist, Yannis Ritsos, the most prolific and
probably also the most popular Greek poet of the century, spent several
years in internal exile on Aegean islands and under house arrest. According
to the clumsy metaphor beloved of the military rulers, Greece had become a
hospital patient strapped in a plaster cast as a necessary step to recovery.
After six and a half years of this, the Yom Kippur War in the autumn of
1973 brought turmoil to the entire Western economy. Boom time for Greece
was finally over.37
That November, a sit-in by students at the Athens Polytechnic drew
thousands to the city centre to protest against the regime. In the early hours
of Saturday, 17 November, a bloody crackdown began. Tanks, armed
police, and soldiers were deployed against students and sympathisers whose
only weapon was a short-wave radio station, that broadcast appeals for the
regime to be overthrown and finally, desperately, for supplies of blood and
bandages. Twenty-four demonstrators were killed that night; perhaps as
many more by army sharpshooters in the streets during the days that
followed. Hundreds were wounded. Thousands were either arrested or went
into hiding. A week later, another coup d’état brought to power an even
more hard-line faction within the military.38
The new rulers finally overreached themselves when they tried to extend
their influence across the eastern Mediterranean to Cyprus. Back in the
early 1950s, when Great Britain had started to withdraw from its imperial
role overseas, the Greeks of Cyprus had petitioned for their island to
become part of Greece. When that was rebuffed by a British Conservative
government, the Greek Cypriots had taken matters into their own hands. A
messy and sometimes brutal three-way conflict, involving Greece, Britain,
and Turkey, had ended with an outcome that nobody had wanted, least of all

the Greek Cypriots, when a newly created Republic of Cyprus became an
independent member of the British Commonwealth in August 1960. Its first
president was Archbishop Makarios, the charismatic head of the Orthodox
Church on the island who had led the political wing of the struggle against
the British for union with Greece.39
In July 1974, the military rulers of Greece staged a coup against the
elected government of Cyprus. For several hours it appeared that Makarios
had been killed. These actions were in flagrant violation of the treaty of
independence, which was supposed to be guaranteed by Britain, Greece,
and Turkey. After a daring escape from the ruins of the presidential palace
in Nicosia, Makarios was flown to London by his old enemies, the British.
But then the British government, led by Harold Wilson, declined to become
involved.40 Instead of a diplomatic initiative to restore the legitimate
government of Cyprus, Turkey launched a massive air and sea assault on
the island’s north coast during the night of 19–20 July 1974. Faced with a
war that they themselves had provoked, and could not possibly win, the
military rulers in Athens panicked and stood down. Democracy was
restored four days later. The first parliamentary elections in almost a decade
were held in November. Shortly afterwards, for the second time in the
country’s history, a plebiscite abolished the monarchy, and the Kingdom of
Greece became the Hellenic Republic, as it has remained ever since.
For the second time, too, since the ill-fated push into Anatolia in 1921, a
military adventure by the Greek state had caused irreparable destruction to a
portion of the wider Greek nation. More than a hundred thousand Greek
Cypriots were either killed or forced from their homes in July and August
1974; the fate of many would never be known. This time there was no
organised exchange of populations; tens of thousands of Greek Cypriots
fled for their lives to the south of the island, and Turkish Cypriots to the
north. No internationally agreed peace treaty has ever brought the war of
that summer to an end. The line of control that still runs from west to east
across the island of Cyprus is a ceasefire line, not a frontier. This was the
price paid for the final healing of the wounds of divided Greece, that went
all the way back to the second decade of the century.

NEW LEDGERS, NEW LEGENDS
1974–2021

A

n unintended and unforeseen consequence of the events of 1974 was

that from that time onwards there has been not one but two Greek nationstates: the Hellenic Republic, with Athens as its capital, and the Republic of
Cyprus, with its capital in Nicosia. Although the Cypriot constitution of
1960 is still legally in force and applies to the entire island, the reality since
1974 has been that the internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus,
which controls the south of the island, is a Greek-speaking state, while the
self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, in the north, is
recognised only by Turkey. For thirty years, it was forbidden for Cypriots
on either side to cross the ceasefire line; since the opening of official
crossing points in 2004, there has been little mingling between ever more
separate Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.1
Both republics (Greece and Cyprus) share the same national day and
national anthem. In the Republic of Cyprus, it is as common to see the
national flag of Greece flying on public buildings, and even on churches, as
the official flag that had been devised for the island’s independence. Subtle
differences of emphasis, as well as the system of government and a
distinctive Cypriot accent, mark the two nation-states off from one another.
But in terms of policy, since 1974 (and in strong contrast to the decade
before that), the two governments have tended to move in lockstep.

In the immediate aftermath of the events of that year, Athens and Nicosia
both made great strides in developing and embedding their democratic
institutions. Since that time, power has regularly changed hands after
elections that have been fairly contested (as had all too rarely been the case
in Greece before that), with a broad spectrum of political parties taking part.
In Athens, a stable two-party system emerged. From the late 1970s until
2012, governments almost always alternated between the centre-right New
Democracy, founded by Konstantinos Karamanlis, who became prime
minister in 1974, and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (known by the
Greek acronym PASOK), led by Andreas Papandreou. From being a
strongly left-wing populist movement in its early years, PASOK soon
morphed into a centre-left party, close to the European mainstream, and was
almost technocratic during the premiership of its second leader, Kostas
Simitis, from 1996 to 2004. In Greece, the head of state is elected by
parliament and the role is largely ceremonial. In Cyprus, on the other hand,
the president has considerable executive powers and is directly elected.
Since the time of Makarios, who died in 1977, presidents have been elected
from political backgrounds ranging from the communist left to the
nationalist right, and not necessarily aligned with the majority party in the
House of Representatives.
Both Greece and Cyprus recovered quickly from the economic downturn
of the mid-1970s and, in the case of Cyprus, from the far greater
devastation caused by the Turkish invasion. Governments in Athens
oversaw impressive growth from the 1980s until the first decade of the new
century. But in hindsight, much of this would turn out to have been stateled. Patronage and tax breaks handed out by three PASOK governments in
the 1980s and 1990s are often blamed for the financial crisis that would
follow in 2010. But for several decades, Greeks in Greece had the
experience of prospering, and the annual rate of growth was impressive.
Standards of living had never been higher.2
All this went hand in hand with a geopolitical shift that affected both
countries. The leadership of the United States in the Cold War meant that
Greece since the late 1940s and Cyprus since independence in 1960 had
looked first to America in international relations. But rightly or wrongly,
since 1974, Greek public opinion has tended to blame US policy for the

seven-year dictatorship in Greece and for what is often called the
‘dismemberment’ of Cyprus. As a result, both countries in the mid-1970s
turned away from the United States and towards what was then the
European Economic Community, the forerunner of today’s European
Union. Greece joined the EEC in 1981 as its tenth member, and the
Eurozone, which shares the single currency, the euro, in 2001. Cyprus was
one of a slew of smaller European states to join the EU in 2004, and it
adopted the euro four years later.
This alignment has meant a great deal more than the technicalities of
working with a supranational administration in Brussels and Strasbourg or
the management and obligations of the single currency. Lifestyles in Greece
became rapidly transformed during the 1980s. People stayed at home and
watched television, newly opened up by the arrival of commercial channels
which had been prohibited before. The traditional men-only kapheneion,
where elderly denizens played backgammon, drank coffee, and disputed the
contents of the daily newspapers, began to be displaced by smart bars where
young people of both sexes would congregate. Not everybody was in
sympathy with these changes, of course, and indeed the old ways have by
no means disappeared. But in a more than superficial sense, since that time,
Greece has become visibly more ‘European’.
The physical landscape has been changing, too. Projects born in the late
1980s and funded by European programmes would go on to be completed
during the next decade and a half. A long-awaited new Metro system for
Athens opened in 2000, the new Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport
in 2001. Thanks to a network of brand new motorways, carried on viaducts
and through long tunnels, journey times from Athens to the provinces, or
from the Adriatic port of Igoumenitsa on one side of the Pindos mountains
to Thessalonica on the other, have been reduced from a whole day or more
to just a few hours. Most spectacular of all is the Charilaos Trikoupis
Suspension Bridge spanning the mouth of the Gulf of Corinth, almost three
kilometres long, which opened to traffic in 2004.
Greek society began to change in the 1980s in other ways, too. These
changes had less to do with European integration than with the advent of
Greece’s first socialist government, led by Andreas Papandreou, in 1981.
Ironically enough, elected on a populist, anti-Europe programme that it
would soon abandon, Papandreou’s Panhellenic Socialist Movement

(PASOK) would govern for seventeen of the next twenty-three years.
Particularly during its first term, it introduced reforms that went far beyond
legislative changes to begin to break down social prejudices that had
remained unchanged for years, if not for centuries. For the first time, a
women’s movement played a visible part in public life. Adultery ceased to
be a criminal offence. Gender equality was introduced into every aspect of
civil society. Civil marriage was permitted, despite protests from the
Orthodox Church, whose monopoly of authority on social matters would be
challenged repeatedly, if often inconclusively, by successive governments.
A national health service was created in 1983. Government spending on
welfare increased by almost half. Huge investments were made in
education, particularly in new and expanded universities and technical
colleges all over Greece. Before long, almost all young Greeks would be
participating in some form of higher education.3
The ending of the Cold War in 1989 brought changes of a different kind.
For the first time in half a century, Greece was once again fully connected
to its Balkan hinterland. Standards of living at the time were much higher in
Greece than in any of the countries of the former Soviet bloc. As the
country’s northern neighbours scrambled to catch up with the capitalist
economies of the West, Greek businesses found themselves at a natural
advantage. On the other hand, large numbers of economic migrants began
to arrive in Greece, particularly, and often illegally, from Albania. The
social problems created at home threatened to outweigh the benefits abroad.
Greeks were spared the resurgence of vicious interethnic (actually,
interreligious) warfare that ravaged the former Yugoslavia during the
decade of the 1990s. But they were not unaffected. In a rare departure from
the EU and NATO consensus, Greek public opinion, and even sometimes
government policy, regularly aligned with the Orthodox Serbs and against
the Catholic Croatians and the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
most contentious issue, which first emerged at the end of 1991 and which
would not be resolved until 2019, was over the name of the independent
republic that broke away from Yugoslavia and claimed international
recognition under the name of ‘Macedonia’.

For as long as it had formed part of the Yugoslav federation, the existence
of a ‘Socialist Republic of Macedonia’ beyond their northern border had
been of no particular concern to Greeks. But for a foreign state to take a
name that by this time almost all Greeks had come to regard as
quintessentially and inalienably Greek was like a red rag to a bull. Worse,
governments of the new republic in the 1990s adopted a flag based on the
gold sunburst motif associated with ancient Macedonian monuments and
most memorably depicted on the funeral casket that had contained the
cremated remains of Philip II. Statues of Alexander the Great began to
appear in Skopje, the republic’s capital; tactless, if unrealistic, remarks by
spokesmen for its government suggested that covetous eyes were being cast
on Thessalonica as a gateway to the Aegean. All this was immediately seen
by most Greeks as an existential threat.
Huge demonstrations of popular anger took place in Greek cities in 1992
and periodically thereafter, whenever a new twist brought the issue to the
surface again. Thessalonica, Greece’s second city and only fifty kilometres
from the border, saw the most vociferous activity. And the popular
outpouring was not confined to Greece. Nowhere was the issue more
divisive than in Australia, where the descendants of immigrants from
Yugoslavia, including many who now identified as Macedonians, clashed
with Greek Australians in the streets of Melbourne and other cities. At issue
was not the existence or the independence of the breakaway republic but its
name. Feeling went right to the top of government, where a split over the
issue was enough to bring down the New Democracy administration in
1993. Only in 2018 would a compromise solution be found and ratified on
both sides a year later. Greece’s northern neighbour is now officially known
as ‘North Macedonia’.4
‘Macedonia is Greek. Read history’ proclaimed lapel badges worn by
ground staff at Greek airports in the 1990s. Of course, the ancestors of all
the Slavonic languages, or dialects, spoken in the southern Balkans in
modern times did not appear on the scene until almost a thousand years
after the time of Philip II and Alexander. But the Athenian orator
Demosthenes could not have disagreed more with the badge wearers,
demonstrators, and politicians who pushed the issue to international
prominence during three decades around the turn of the twenty-first century.

One consequence of the dispute is that, since the 1990s, many Greeks have
been sensitive to any questioning of the ethnic identity of the ancient
Macedonians—the very issue that had provoked such heated debates in
Athens almost two and a half thousand years ago.
In August 2004, the Olympic Games were held in Athens for the second
time. Once again, after a little over a century, the nation-state was on
display before the eyes of the world. Despite much carping and doubting in
advance, Greek state and private organisations proved themselves more
than equal to the immense logistical challenges of hosting the modern
Games. Infrastructure was ready on time, if only just. All over the country,
public spaces, hotels, and venues had had a facelift for the occasion. In the
centre of Athens, below the Acropolis, streets were pedestrianised and
landscaped; those neoclassical buildings of the nineteenth century that had
escaped the bulldozers of the twentieth were tastefully restored and
repainted. The opening pageant that preceded the Games seamlessly
presented vignettes from Greek history, from the mysterious marble
figurines from the Cyclades that long predate the oldest evidence for the
Greek language, down to the traditional music of the bouzouki and the
paintings of the twentieth-century artist Yannis Tsarouchis. High above all
floated a winged angel. Here was the elusive spirit of ‘Greekness’, that had
been so anxiously sought back in the 1930s, made manifest and presented
on the world stage using the latest in showbiz technology.
But Greece, as the poet Seferis had written back then, was ‘still
travelling’. Three years before the first Athens Olympics, held in 1896, the
country had declared bankruptcy. Six years after the second Games,
European governments and banks were reeling from the long-term effects
of the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. In the spring of 2010, the
PASOK government led by George Papandreou could no longer borrow
enough to service its existing debts. Normally, in such circumstances, a
government would default on part of its loans. Had that happened, it would
have been the seventh time in the history of the Greek state. But Greece was
now part of the Eurozone; a Greek default would have consequences for the
rest of the EU and, beyond it, for the entire world banking system, that were
literally unimaginable—because no one had thought to imagine them.5

As the crisis exploded across international markets, the cartoonists of the
world’s press delighted in poking fun at the hapless and incompetent heirs
to a once-great civilisation. If the classical heritage had once served Greeks
well in the early, formative stages of building a nation-state, it had now—
and not for the first time—returned as a stick to beat them with. Ancient
temples riven with cracks, a discus in the form of a one-euro coin being
thrown into a dustbin by a naked athlete perched on a Doric column, a
caricature of a symposium as depicted on an ancient vase: these were easy
targets and all too recognisable.6
To avoid a formal bankruptcy, a system of bailouts for the beleaguered
Greek government was devised. Greek elected politicians and officials had
no more say in the arrangements hurriedly devised to ‘rescue’ them than
they had had in determining the terms of their independence in the early
1830s. Known technically as ‘memoranda of understanding’, lifesaving
loans from a ‘troika’ made up of two European institutions and the
International Monetary Fund staved off a formal default and ensured that
Greece did not crash out of the Eurozone, perhaps to bring the whole
edifice down with it. Successive Greek governments received three such
bailouts, in 2010, 2012, and 2015. But the price was to shrink the size of the
Greek economy by a quarter; unemployment for several years stood at over
25 per cent, and more than double that among young adults. Between 2010
and the middle of the decade, Greece experienced what at the time was the
largest downturn for a developed economy in peacetime anywhere in the
world. Cyprus was not immune either, largely thanks to the exposure of its
banks to Greek debt. Even more demanding terms were imposed on the
government of Cyprus in return for a bailout in 2013, although there the
recovery would follow much more quickly than in Greece.
In Greek towns and cities, suicide rates soared, shops and businesses
closed. Long queues formed at soup kitchens set up by the Orthodox
Church and public charities. Graffiti—sometimes sharply witty, sometimes
expressing deep despair or defiance—sprawled over abandoned
construction sites and the walls of homes and offices. Unable to find work
at home, young graduates left the country in droves to seek work in other
EU countries. In the first years, public anger several times spilled out onto
the streets. In June 2011, three employees died inside a bank in central

Athens when demonstrators set fire to it. Further violent demonstrations
accompanied the signing of the second bailout in February 2012.
Even democratic institutions for a time looked fragile. An inconclusive
parliamentary election in May that year was followed by a second, six
weeks later. The centre-right New Democracy was able to form a
government only thanks to the support of its rival PASOK and a small
fringe party on the left. But a new force had emerged to lead the opposition
and break the two-party consensus that had been stable for almost forty
years. This was the Coalition of the Radical Left, known by its Greek
acronym SYRIZA, a far-left party fighting on an avowedly populist
platform. Also populist in its tactics was Golden Dawn, Greece’s only
fascist or neo-Nazi party. Openly linked to armed gangs and intimidation,
its members sporting Nazi-style insignia and uniforms, and crudely racist in
its public pronouncements, Golden Dawn entered parliament for the first
time with almost half a million votes in 2012.7
Populist rhetoric swept the board three years later when Alexis Tsipras
was elected to head a SYRIZA government in January 2015. Tellingly, this
was in coalition with another fringe party that shared the same kind of
populist platform, but this time belonged to the Far Right (though well short
of the extreme position occupied by Golden Dawn, which all other parties
shunned). For six months in 2015, relying on the defiant slogans of its
election programme, the SYRIZA-led government embarked on a collision
course with the European institutions and the International Monetary Fund,
which were its only economic lifeline. In June, with the banks closed and
the country only days away from formal bankruptcy and a catastrophic
crash-out from the Eurozone, Tsipras called a referendum at only a week’s
notice. A majority voted to reject the terms laid down by the institutions.
This was the moment when a populist government stared into the abyss and
turned away from disaster at the last possible moment. A third (and, as it
turned out, final) bailout was signed a few days later. And in September,
Tsipras won a snap election, having shed the most extreme elements in his
party. Greece’s short-lived experiment with populist politics was over.
During the next three and a half years, SYRIZA under Tsipras would tack—
even if erratically—towards the centre-left mainstream.8

In the parliamentary election of July 2019, the pendulum swung back to
New Democracy, which won a clear mandate under its new leader,
Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The two-party system that had served the country so
well for four decades was restored—with the formerly far-left SYRIZA
now taking the place of PASOK as a more or less centre-left opposition.
The extremist Golden Dawn failed to meet the threshold for representation
in parliament. A year later, a five-year court case ended in October 2020
with the leader and the most prominent members of Golden Dawn
convicted of running a criminal organisation in the guise of a political party.
Six of them received jail terms of thirteen years—not for their political
beliefs but for proven acts of violence and intimidation, including
complicity in the notorious murder of the rap artist Pavlos Fyssas in 2013.9
Between 2012 and 2019, in no fewer than five general elections and one
referendum, Greek voters tried every possible democratic route to solving
the economic and social crisis of the decade. To what extent any or all of
these governments can be credited with its eventual ‘solution’ is perhaps
debatable. But by early in 2020, the crisis did finally seem to be at an end.
And despite dire prognostications in many quarters, public order had not
broken down. Greeks had turned their backs on the kind of populism that
had been gaining ground in other parts of the world—from Turkey and
Russia to the USA and even the UK. They had come through the crisis—
thanks to reliance on the deeply traditional resource of the family and a
quality of inner strength that can best be translated as ‘endurance’ or
‘patient resignation’.10
And in the process they had not turned against the European Union or its
institutions. Although opinion polls conducted since 2015 in Greece have
shown a drop in public support for membership in the Eurozone, even at the
nadir in 2017 it did not fall below 50 per cent. In the European elections of
May 2019, only fringe parties supported a departure from the EU, and they
attracted very few votes.11 Neither in Greece nor in Cyprus has there been
much public appetite for following the example of Brexit, despite having
suffered what might be regarded as the severest provocations experienced
anywhere in the Union. The geopolitical advantages of solidarity with the
bloc still outweigh the claims of a more rigorously defined sovereignty in
the minds of voters.

Nor, despite the intense pressures of the crisis decade, has Greece seen
any sign of the breakaway movements that have been growing in some
parts of Europe in recent years. Whether there remains any appetite for an
eventual unification between the Republic of Cyprus and Greece must be a
moot point. But in outlying regions within Greece which boast a strong
regional identity, such as Crete, Macedonia, or Epiros, the overwhelming
impetus over the last two hundred years has been to join with the national
state and, once having joined, to stay joined. Greece has no equivalent to
Catalonia or the Basque region within Spain, or Scotland within the United
Kingdom.
Even while the crisis was at its height, other news was far more positive
(and largely neglected by the world’s media). Offshore, the extraordinary
success story of Greek shipping continued unabated, even if with less of the
glamour associated with an Onassis or a Niarchos. The Greek-owned cargo
fleet is now reckoned to be the largest in the world, with a 17.3 per cent
share of world tonnage recorded in 2018—a remarkable figure when set
alongside Greece’s share of world population, a mere 0.13 per cent.12 And
although these Greek-owned businesses remain as multinational as they
always were, they have contributed spectacular benefits to Greeks
worldwide, as well as to the infrastructure of the Greek state. Charitable
foundations formed from the bequests of several leading shipowners of the
postwar period, and bearing their names, disburse huge sums to support
Greeks in need and to promote Greek culture and education, as well as for
broader philanthropic purposes—while their assets remain, as ever, well
beyond the reach of the Greek state.13

Onassis, the tycoon’s son killed in an air accident in 1973, was opened in
1992. In 2010, just as the financial crisis was beginning to bite, the Onassis
Foundation inaugurated a state-of-the-art centre for the performing arts in
Athens. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center, funded from the
estate of Onassis’s great rival, was gifted to the Greek state and opened in
2017, on land near the sea at Phaleron that in ancient times had been used
for public executions and more recently had been occupied by a race
course. A beautifully landscaped park, with ponds and fountains, provides a

stunning setting for the newly built and lavishly equipped home of the
national opera company and the new National Library of Greece.
These achievements have been built upon Greek enterprise in faraway
parts of the world. But the opposite process is also at work: Chinese firms
have been investing heavily in infrastructure in both Greece and Cyprus.
Part of the port of Piraeus is now Chinese-owned, and in November 2019
Greece joined China’s controversial Belt and Road Initiative, which many
see as an attempt to spread Chinese economic and political influence around
the world. In Cyprus, wealthy Russian businessmen have been offered
citizenship, which brings the benefit of free movement within the European
Union, in return for inward investment in the Cypriot economy—although
some restrictions were announced in autumn 2020. Arrivals at Larnaca
International Airport in recent years have been greeted by glitzy
advertising, apparently for real estate and business opportunities, with text
entirely in either Russian or Chinese. These latest manifestations of
globalisation are not universally welcomed. But they do show Greeks
continuing to interact with all comers, wherever in the world they can
reach, as they have done throughout all their long history.
Less controversial, though not without its attendant problems too, has
been the tourist industry. From modest beginnings in the 1960s, when mass
tourism was just beginning, annual numbers of tourist arrivals in Greece
had topped thirty million by 2018—three times the country’s population.
Unlike the shipping business or (perhaps) inward investment from Russia or
China, tourism is very much an onshore enterprise. Its benefits are
immediate and obvious in terms of local infrastructure, employment
opportunities, and revenue available to the Greek state through taxation. On
the other hand, the impact on the landscape, ecology, and (as some have
complained ever since the days of 1960s hippies) local standards of
behaviour may be less beneficial. Mass tourism and its associated building
projects have surely blighted the natural beauty of many a Greek island and
coastline—though to a far less extent than in some other parts of the
Mediterranean.
Until the Covid-19 pandemic struck early in 2020, the outlook for the
economies of Greece and Cyprus, and for international Greek enterprise,
was brighter than at any time for more than a decade.

In 2021, as Greece and Greeks worldwide commemorate two hundred years
since the start of the Revolution that inaugurated the first Greek state, the
pandemic is only one of several challenges that they face. And these are all
of them as much global as they are local.
By the time the second wave of the virus began to sweep across Europe at
the end of 2020, the two Greek-speaking states had fared relatively less
badly than most of the rest of the continent. Some have put this down to
climate—an unconscious echo, perhaps, of Winckelmann’s explanation, in
the eighteenth century, for the glories of classical sculpture. Others, more
plausibly, have given the credit to governments which acted promptly and
decisively in the early phase of the pandemic, then cautiously managed to
save something of the summer tourist season, and with it their national
economies, without at the same time importing dangerous levels of
infection from abroad. It may also be relevant that both Greece and Cyprus
have within living memory experienced curfews and restrictions on civil
liberties far harsher and more rigorously enforced than any lockdown so far
imposed, at least in the West, to combat Covid-19.
Other threats are of longer standing. Ever since deposits of crude oil were
first discovered beneath the seabed off the northern Aegean island of
Thasos at the end of 1973, Greece has resisted attempts by its neighbour
Turkey to claim jurisdiction in and beneath the Aegean Sea and in the air
above it. Successive governments on both sides have alternated between
periods of tension and relative degrees of rapprochement. The spectre of
armed conflict between the two NATO allies has returned roughly once per
decade since 1976, when the leader of Greece’s official opposition called
for a Turkish exploration vessel to be torpedoed in the Aegean.
The discovery in 2011 of the Aphrodite oil field off the coast of Cyprus
raised the stakes and brought in additional players, including Israel and
Egypt. Further finds of oil and gas were made during 2019. When the
Cyprus government granted a licence later that year for production to go
ahead in its territorial waters, Turkey countered with new claims of its own.
Since then, both republics, Greece and Cyprus, have watched with
increasing anxiety as the policies of the Turkish president Recip Tayyip
Erdoğan seek to extend his country’s geopolitical influence in the region in
ways that directly threaten their interests. The Greek and Cypriot
governments continue to insist on an internationalist position and on finding

solutions within the framework of existing maritime law, treaties, and a
rule-governed international system. There is an obvious pragmatic rationale
for this approach, given the strategic imbalance between the two sides; but
the underlying principles can be traced back to the circumstances in which
first Greece and, much later, Cyprus gained their independence. These
principles are probably of greater long-term importance than the outcome of
a spat over the exploitation of oil and gas at a time when most of the
world’s governments, and even leading oil companies, are moving away
from dependence on carbon-based sources of energy in response to the
greater threat from climate change.14
A challenge of a different kind, and quite new, at least in modern times,
comes from inward migration. For centuries—indeed, quite possibly going
back as far as the Bronze Age Mycenaeans—young Greeks had left their
homeland in large numbers to seek their fortune elsewhere in the world.
Now, since the early 1990s, the world has been coming to them.
The opening of the Cold War frontiers at the end of 1989 was only a
beginning. By the turn of the new century, migrants and asylum seekers
were reaching the country, via Turkey, from all over the Middle East, East
Asia, and parts of Africa. Problems of housing, integration, exploitation of
migrants by criminal gangs, and petty criminality followed, particularly in
Athens and Thessalonica—conditions which may have contributed to the
rise of Golden Dawn as a political force. Because a high proportion of these
new immigrants were Muslim, a nation which had fought for its
independence under the banner of Orthodox Christianity has now once
again begun to find itself home to a significant and increasing Muslim
population. It would take years of wrangling before the first official mosque
to function in Athens in almost two hundred years opened its doors to
worshippers in November 2020.
But nothing could have prepared the authorities for the mass arrivals into
Greece of refugees fleeing wars and turmoil in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq,
Sudan, and even sub-Saharan Africa. This new crisis reached its peak in
2015, just at the time when the country was undergoing the most testing
period of its domestic problems. In that year alone, over eight hundred
thousand migrants, most of them in unseaworthy open boats, arrived on the
Greek islands closest to Turkey. For the great majority, the goal was not to

settle in Greece but to find asylum in the larger and more prosperous
countries of the European Union. Then, in 2016, European states began to
close their borders to migrants. The problem for Greece, as well as for the
migrants themselves, became dramatically worse. At the time of writing,
neither attempts by the institutions of the EU to share the burden among
European states nor negotiations between the EU and Turkey have
produced more than temporary, limited solutions. On Lesbos, the infamous
Moria camp, built to house three thousand asylum seekers, had been packed
with five times that number by the time it burned down in September
2020.15
Stories of traditional Greek warm-heartedness towards these new arrivals
on their shores have given way to ominous signs of resentment at a problem
that local or national governments cannot solve. Violence towards refugees
on Lesbos and other islands is reported to be on the increase; public
demands, demonstrations, and other forms of action have been growing on
the most affected islands since the middle of the last decade. Today, Greece
and Greeks find themselves on the front line (or one of the front lines) of a
global problem that shows no sign of going away.

EPILOGUE

M

and a half thousand years have passed since that
imagined dawn over the Aegean with which this story began. In all that
time, speakers of the Greek language have never ceased to reinvent
themselves. There is every reason to suppose that they will go on doing so,
in ways that we cannot imagine or predict, for long into the future.
Today, Greeks live and flourish on every inhabited continent. In 2011,
Greece itself, according to the most recent census, was home to just under
eleven million. The population of the Greek-speaking Republic of Cyprus at
the same time was just over eight hundred thousand. No one knows for
certain how many more people around the world speak Greek as a first or a
heritage language or consider themselves to be of Greek descent.
Communities of more than one hundred thousand can be found in the
United States, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, spread across
several republics of the former Soviet Union, and (largely originating from
Cyprus) Great Britain. A total figure of seven million, settled in 141
countries, has been hazarded. Even if these numbers are inflated, it is quite
probable that up to half as many Greeks again live outside the Hellenic
Republic as within its borders.1 That is a very different ratio from the threeto-one that existed at the time when the Greek state was first created. But it
is still an important reminder that the story of the Greeks is not just the
story of Greece. And, since the nineteenth century, the dispersed Greekspeaking world once again has a geographical and emotional centre that
most, if not all Greeks, irrespective of where they live, can identify with.
Constantinople as the centre of a world empire (once) and a universal
church (still) retains its hold on the imagination and the loyalty of a
majority of Greeks who maintain their links to the Orthodox branch of
Christianity. But the political centre of the Greek-speaking world since the
ore than three

1920s has been the national capital, Athens—which is also home to almost
half the population of Greece. Greek communities around the world
regularly lobby their own governments to support Greek interests in matters
of foreign policy (and usually irrespective of whichever party is in power in
Greece at the time). This has been most evident with the Greek American
lobby in the United States, which scored notable successes particularly in
the 1970s and 1980s. But it is a stance that has repeatedly been echoed
around the world, to the extent that governments in both Greece and the
Republic of Cyprus have come to rely on support from expatriate
communities abroad.2
For these reasons, it does make sense, today, to talk of a Greek diaspora—
meaning specifically the descendants of people who emigrated from the
‘old’ Greek-speaking world, as it was in the eighteenth century, to create
new communities around the world in the nineteenth, twentieth, and—who
knows?—perhaps also the twenty-first. Wherever these people are to be
found, and regardless of the citizenship they hold, overwhelmingly they
continue to think of themselves as Greek and to identify, to varying extents,
with their idea of a Greek state to which they feel that they, too, belong.
However divided Greece has been within itself at various times in its twohundred-year history, no organised political alternative or rival to that state
has ever emerged from the Greek diaspora—or, surely, is likely to. And
although the old term of self-designation, Romios, can still be heard in
certain contexts, every Greek, everywhere in the world, is today a Hellene
in his or her own language.
Today, Astoria in the New York Borough of Queens is perhaps the biggest
Greek village in the world. But Greek Americans who may now be of the
fifth or sixth generation do not necessarily speak Greek well, or even at all.
In the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria during the 1970s
and 1980s, government policy encouraged education in heritage languages.
The children of Greek immigrants could take their lessons and exams at
school in Greek; university courses in Modern Greek studies were full. But
after changes in policy during the 1990s, these possibilities no longer exist.
Third-generation Greek Australians are less likely to speak the language of
their parents and grandparents, or to want to learn it.

It was ever thus. In centuries past, individuals and whole communities
whose mother tongue was Greek might lose their language in favour of
Latin, Arabic, Slavonic, Turkish, or French. English is only the most recent
of these. But in every generation, at least as many kept faith with the
language of their earliest years. And the centuries-old process of ‘becoming
Greek’ has never quite ended either. For at least some of those who have
arrived, fleeing persecution or hardship at home, landfall on a Greek island
has been something more than a transitory step on a desperate, possibly
unending journey. Hiva Panahi is a refugee from Iran who has made her
home in Greece since 2000. A decade later, she was writing and publishing
poems in Greek, as well as in her native Kurdish. This poem is called ‘The
Breath of the Olive Tree’:
We the wandering
We the barefoot
We without space or country
We the burnt and fiery winds
We saw you, with those final breaths
That burned a piece of the sea.3
In these lines, a twenty-first-century refugee captures her first encounter
with an Aegean landscape that has been celebrated by travellers, poets, and
artists ever since Homer sang of the ‘wine-dark sea’ some thirty centuries
ago—how else but in her newly adopted language, Greek.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This book would never have been written but for two people: my agent, the
late Felicity Bryan, and Alex Bowler, who now oversees publishing at
Faber. Back in 2016, Felicity was seeking a publisher for another book of
mine. Among the rejection letters she passed on to me was one that said (in
effect), ‘Why doesn’t he write the whole history of the Greeks?’ The
challenge had been thrown down. And no sooner had my earlier book gone
to press than I began to flesh out the idea for The Greeks. I hadn’t
remembered where that rejection letter came from. But Felicity did. It came
from Alex Bowler, who by then had recently taken up his post at Faber. The
three of us met together only once, just after the contract had been signed.
And this book is the result.
Felicity was the best agent any writer could wish for. Her loss to cancer at
the age of seventy-four in June 2020 was felt throughout the publishing
world, and there are many fitting tributes to her already in print. I had come
to know Felicity relatively late in our respective careers. We met quite
rarely (even before Covid-19 kept us all at home). But with her passing, I
knew that I had lost a friend. Being a literary agent, for Felicity, was so
much more than a business. She loved books and people; she knew what
she liked, and she had the gift for making others as enthusiastic as she was.
Alex has stood by me from first to last, despite the responsibilities of a
role that goes far beyond that of a commissioning editor. He was the first
person to read the whole of this book in draft, and his observations and
queries on the early chapters were full of insights that helped to guide me
through the many thickets that lay ahead. I have also been fortunate in
being able to call on friends who kindly read several chapters and
generously gave me the benefit of their experience and expertise which
goes far beyond my own: Professor John Bennet on the Mycenaean period
and the dark age; Professor Paul Cartledge on ancient Greece; Assistant
Professor Dionysios Stathakopoulos on the Byzantine millennium; and Dr

John Kittmer, who served as British ambassador to Greece from 2013 to
2016, on the final chapters.
In preparing the book for press, I have benefited hugely from the
encouragement and support of Brian Distelberg, editorial director at Basic
Books, who commissioned the US edition. His colleague Emma Berry also
contributed much thoughtful feedback. The near-final text was read, with a
meticulous and sympathetic eye, by Eleo Carson on behalf of Faber, not
once but twice. For whatever blemishes or omissions remain, I alone must
take the blame.
For moral and practical support, I have accumulated debts too numerous
to name. John Bennet not only gave expert advice, but as Director of the
British School at Athens throughout the time that I was working on this
project, he and his colleagues have given me their time, their friendship,
and on numerous occasions, before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a
roof over my head in the friendly and congenial atmosphere of the BSA, set
in its delightful garden hidden away in the centre of dusty, noisy Athens.
The School’s administrator, Dr Tania Gerousi; the archivist, Amalia
Kakissis; Vicki Tzavara in the front office; and Penny Wilson, the librarian
until 2019—all went out of their way to assist me while I was writing this
book.
I was fortunate, too, to enjoy the hospitality of the British Embassy in
Athens, where Kate Smith, in post from 2017 to 2021, has also become a
good friend. I thank the Greek ambassador to London during most of this
period, Mr Dimitrios Caramitsos-Tziras, for many kindnesses. Professor
Maria Georgopoulou and Professor David Holton helped with specific
queries during lockdown, as did the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic
Studies and the librarians of the collection that the society shares with the
Roman Society and the Institute for Classical Studies at the University of
London.
At King’s College London, Gonda Van Steen, my successor as Koraes
Professor, has been generous with institutional and moral support whenever
I needed it. Many others, whose names appear among the sources in the
Notes at the end of the book, have contributed, too, not only through their
published work but often through discussions and interactions that have
taken place over many years, and helped to shape my thinking about the
Greeks and the Greek-speaking world.

The book in its finished form owes a great deal to the superb
professionalism of several people: Cecilia Mackay, the able and
sympathetic picture researcher with whom it has been a pleasure to work
for the second time; Fred Courtwright, who secured permissions to quote
from material in copyright; Patti Isaacs, who drew the maps; and Christina
Palaia, my copy editor at Basic Books. Special thanks for ensuring a
smooth path to publication go to Carrie Plitt at the Felicity Bryan Agency in
Oxford and her counterpart Zoë Pagnamenta in New York. It has been a
pleasure, and at times even an education, to work with all of them. And the
biggest thank-you of all goes to my wife, Fran, for—well—everything, but
not least for her patient and eagle-eyed reading of so many different
versions of The Greeks.

NOTES
References to Ancient Texts and Abbreviations Used in the Notes
Most of the ancient Greek (and Latin) texts referenced in the notes which
follow have been translated many times. Older translations, out of
copyright, are freely available to read on the internet; Greek texts can be
found on sites such as Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (subscription required)
or Perseus Digital Library: Greek and Roman Materials. Rather than full
bibliographical details of any one edition or translation, in references I give
only the author’s name and the most commonly used English translation of
the title. Where relevant, these are followed by the conventional numbering
of books and lines (for verse) or paragraphs (for prose) common to all
modern editions and most translations (without comma, to distinguish them
from page numbers in all other references). For a small number of ancient
works I use these standard abbreviations:

29. This and the previous paragraph are based closely on the two ancient
sources for these events: Diod. Sic. 16.91–95 (written during the first
century BCE) and Justin 9.6–7 (a later abridgement of a Latin history, also
of the first century BCE). There are discrepancies between them in some
details, which have been differently interpreted by modern historians. For
the date (July or October), see A. B. Bosworth, Conquest and Empire: The
Reign of Alexander the Great (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,

1993), 23; Lane Fox, ‘Philip’s and Alexander’s Macedon’, 385. See also

31. Worthington lists the ancient sources (Philip, 269n45) and some
modern approaches and contrasting verdicts (269–270n56). For the view
that Alexander was not involved, with references to earlier scholarship on
the subject, see Bosworth, Conquest, 25–26. Alexander’s guilt has been
proposed by Ernst Badian, ‘The Death of Philip II’, Phoenix 17 (1963),

3. An exception in the east was the province of Dacia, the region of the
Balkans to the north of the Danube, that was conquered by Trajan in the
early first century CE. There, Latin was spoken (and Latin-derived
Romanian still is, today). In the west, significant Greek-speaking
communities existed at Rome, Carthage, and Lugdunum in Gaul (today’s
Lyon). On possible exceptions in Sicily and southern Italy, see next note.

22. Of the five Greek novels of this period which survive complete, the
best known are Longus, Daphnis and Chloe; Achilles Tatius, Leucippe and
Cleitophon (both written in the late second century CE); and Heliodorus,
Aethiopica. The last has long been dated to the late fourth century, wrongly
in my view. For the arguments supporting a date around 215 CE, much
closer to the other novels and to the Second Sophistic, to which it clearly
belongs, see Swain, Hellenism, 423–424; Lane Fox, Pagans, 137–138;

PRAISE FOR THE GREEKS
“A monumental, sweeping history of the Greeks covering more than three
thousand years right up to the present day. Authoritative, compelling, and
beautifully written. A wonderful book.”
—Peter Frankopan, author of The Silk Roads
“A masterpiece, from a towering expert in all things Greek.”
—Gregory Nagy, Harvard University
“Roderick Beaton has given us a wonderful big picture of the Greeks, with
a very generous cross-cultural, temporal, and geographical sweep. At the
same time, the book’s solid detail and careful distinctions—for example,
between the Platonic and the Christian vocabulary for ‘virtue’—should help
in discouraging political exploitation of stilted, anachronistic ideas about
Greek civilization.”
—Sarah Ruden, translator and author of Paul Among the People
“Over three millennia, the locus of the Greek spirit has shifted perpetually.
In antiquity it darted about between the cities, harbors, and mountain
valleys of the east Mediterranean, moving eventually through the swathes
of North Africa, the Levant, and southwest Asia where Alexander and his
successors held sway. In modern times, it has flowed between the footloose
global diaspora and the two volatile states which embody Greekness. In a
tour de force, Beaton has managed to tie this story together in a single
compelling narrative, written with deep affection and hard-earned
knowledge of all things Greek.”
—Bruce Clark, author of Athens: A History
“A remarkable and readable book: this single, masterful volume lays out the
entire thirty-five-century history of the Greek-speaking peoples. From
Minoan to modern times, their triumphs, their tragedies, and above all their
endurance are all here. For anyone who wants to understand Greece today,
this is the place to start.”

—Ian Morris, author of Why the West Rules—for Now
“Histories of the Greeks have so far been written with a classical or a
modern bias, but Beaton does not play favorites: with the vantage-point of a
scholar enjoying a deep knowledge of Byzantium as well as all phases of
Greek literature, he weaves together a vivid narrative reaching from the age
of heroes and lore down to the present. The Greeks emerge not as a single
nation but rather as a series of great civilizations. They were often at odds
with each other but, in all phases of their long history, contributed cultural
capital to the rest of the world. Beaton’s Greeks are always on the move,
self-reflexive, and surprising. Their story has not yet been told in a global
fashion, as it is here.”
—Anthony Kaldellis, Ohio State University
“Professor Beaton, already very well known as a formidable and
distinguished exponent of modern Greek history, here expands
exponentially his vision and chronological scope and turns his more than
competent hand to composing a comprehensive history of Greeks, or rather
Hellenes, from the Late Bronze Age BCE to the present day. His
handsomely illustrated and fully documented text is a consistently
illuminating encapsulation of the manifold achievements of one of the
globe’s most creative and inspirational peoples.”
—Paul Cartledge, Cambridge University
